In this study we assessed temporal changes in urinary and sexual function up to 5 years following radical prostatectomy in a population based cohort. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A sample of 1,288 men with localized prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy and completed a baseline survey within 6 to 12 months of diagnosis were included in the analysis. Two and 5-year functional and quality of life data were collected, as was information on the use of erectile aids. Temporal functional changes and potentially confounding or modifying factors were assessed using longitudinal regression models. RESULTS: Of these men 14% reported frequent urinary leakage or no urinary control 60 months after diagnosis, which was slightly higher than the 10% reporting incontinence at 24 months (p = 0.007). At 60 months 28% of the men had erections firm enough for intercourse compared with 22% at 24 months (p = 0.003). Sildenafil was the most commonly used erectile aid (43% ever used) and 45% of users reported that it helped 'somewhat' or 'a lot.' CONCLUSIONS: Urinary and sexual dysfunction were common 5 years following radical prostatectomy in this large, community based cohort of prostate cancer survivors. While a small minority of subjects experienced changes in urinary or sexual function between years 2 and 5 after prostatectomy, functional outcomes remained relatively stable in the majority of participants","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,"Health Services and Economics Branch, Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Progra, Surveillance Research Program, Applied Research Program",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=15821561,0,1,0,0

We assessed this further using 4 day food records (FRs) and FFQs in a large sample. METHODS: Participants were from the non-intervention group of the dietary modification component of the Women's Health Initiative Clinical Trial: 603 breast cancer cases and 1206 controls matched on age, clinic, and length of follow-up. Relative risks (RRs) were estimated using unconditional logistic regression, adjusted for confounders and for the selection into the trial of women with an FFQ report exceeding 32% calories from fat. Direct comparison of the statistical power of the two instruments used the standardized log RR. An alternative analysis after removing subjects with missing covariate data was also conducted. RESULTS: The RR estimate for breast cancer in the top quintile of total fat intake, adjusted for confounders and total energy, was 1.82 (P for trend 0.02) for the FR but 0.67 for the FFQ (P for trend 0.24). Following adjustment for selection, estimates were 2.09 (P for trend 0.008) for the FR (alternative: 2.54, P for trend 0.006) and 1.71 (P for trend 0.18) for the FFQ (alternative: 1.24, P for trend 0.41). Similar results were seen for fat subtypes, particularly unsaturated fats. Comparisons showed higher statistical power for the FR than the FFQ (e.g. total fat, P = 0.08: alternative P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Alternative instruments, such as FRs, may be preferable to FFQs for evaluating diet-disease relationships in cohort studies.

Mol Biosyst 2015;11(12):3244-3252",2015,A cross-cancer differential co-expression network reveals microRNA-regulated oncogenic functional modules,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that can regulate their target gene expressions at the post-transcriptional level. Moreover, they have been reported as either oncomirs or tumor suppressors and possess therapeutic potential in cancer. In this study, we investigated differential co-expression of miRNAs across four cancer types. We observed that the loss of positive co-expressions among miRNAs frequently occurs in the studied cancer types. This observation suggests that the disruption of positive co-expressions among miRNAs may be prevalent during tumorigenesis. By systematically collecting these lost positive co-expressions among miRNAs in cancer, we constructed a cross-cancer miRNA differential co-expression network. We observed that the influential miRNAs in the proposed network, i.e., hubs or in larger cliques, tended to be involved in more cancer types than other miRNAs. Moreover, we found that miRNAs which lose their positive co-expressions in cancers might co-contribute to cancer development, and even could be used to predict the cancer types in which miRNAs were involved. Finally, we identified two potential miRNA-regulated onco-modules, mitosis and DNA replication, that are associated with poor survival outcomes in patients across multiple cancers. Collectively, our study suggested that the disruption of miRNA positive co-expression in cancer might contribute to cancer development. Our findings also form an important basis for identifying miRNAs with potential co-contribution to carcinogenesis.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Stomach, Ovary, Prostate, Digestive Organs, Female Genital Organs, Lung, Male Genital Organs",Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26448606,0,1,0,0

Minority under-enrolment may be, in part, due to differences in the way clinical trials are discussed in oncology visits with African American vs. White patients. OBJECTIVE: To investigate differences in oncologist-patient communication during offers to participate in clinical trials in oncology visits with African American and White patients. METHODS: From an archive of video-recorded oncology visits, we selected all visits with African American patients that included a trial offer (n = 11) and a matched sample of visits with demographically/medically comparable White patients (n = 11). Using mixed qualitative-quantitative methods, we assessed differences by patient race in (i) word count of entire visits and (ii) frequency of mentions and word count of discussions of clinical trials and key elements of consent. RESULTS: Visits with African American patients, compared to visits with White patients, were shorter overall and included fewer mentions of and less discussion of clinical trials. Also, visits with African Americans included less discussion of the purpose and risks of trials offered, but more discussion of voluntary participation. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: African American patients may make decisions about clinical trial participation based on less discussion with oncologists than do White patients. Possible explanations include a less active communication style of African Americans in medical visits, oncologists' concerns about patient mistrust, and/or oncologist racial bias. Findings suggest oncologists should pay more conscious attention to developing the topic of clinical trials with African American patients, particularly purpose and risks.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=23910630,0,0,0,0

This problem is compounded in regions such as rural Appalachia where rates of smoking are consistently higher than national averages and access to treatments is limited. The current research evaluated a home-based contingency management program completed over the Internet with adolescent smokers recruited from rural Appalachia. Participants (N = 62) submitted 3 video recordings per day showing their breath carbon monoxide (CO) levels using a handheld CO monitor. Participants were assigned to either an active treatment condition (AT; n = 31) in which reductions in breath CO were reinforced or a control treatment condition (CT; n = 31) in which providing timely video recordings were reinforced with no requirement to reduce breath CO. Results revealed that participants in the AT condition reduced their breath CO levels significantly more so during treatment than participants in the CT condition. Within-group comparisons revealed that participants in both conditions significantly reduced their breath CO, self-reported smoking, and nicotine dependence ratings during treatment. However, only participants in the AT condition significantly reduced urinary cotinine levels during treatment, and only participants in this condition maintained all reductions until 6-week post treatment. Participants in the CT condition only maintained self-reported smoking reductions until posttreatment assessments. These results support the feasibility and initial efficacy of this incentive-based approach to smoking cessation with adolescent smokers living in rural locations.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26280592,0,0,0,0

A lead SNP was found to occur on chromosome 9p21.3, a region that is deleted in 30% of childhood ALLs, suggesting the presence of causal polymorphisms linked to ALL risk. We used SNP genotyping and imputation-based fine-mapping of a multiethnic ALL case-control population (Ncases = 1,464, Ncontrols = 3,279) to identify variants of large effect within 9p21.3. We identified a CDKN2A missense variant (rs3731249) with 2% allele frequency in controls that confers three-fold increased risk of ALL in children of European ancestry (OR, 2.99; P = 1.51 x 10(-9)) and Hispanic children (OR, 2.77; P = 3.78 x 10(-4)). Moreover, of 17 patients whose tumors displayed allelic imbalance at CDKN2A, 14 preferentially retained the risk allele and lost the protective allele (PBinomial = 0.006), suggesting that the risk allele provides a selective advantage during tumor growth. Notably, the CDKN2A variant was not significantly associated with melanoma, glioblastoma, or pancreatic cancer risk, implying that this polymorphism specifically confers ALL risk but not general cancer risk.

METHOD: A longitudinal analysis was performed using data from the China Seven Cities Study, a health promotion and smoking prevention study conducted in seven cities across Mainland China between 2002 and 2005. Participants included 5,020 middle and high school students and their parents. Explanatory variables included foreign media exposure, attitude toward appearance, parent education, and family income.

The Generalized Estimating Equation approach was utilized to determine the effect of explanatory variables on overweight status. RESULTS: Among girls, foreign media exposure was significantly negatively associated with general adiposity over time (beta=-0.06, p=0.01 for middle school girls; beta=-0.06, p=0.03 for high school girls). Attitude toward appearance was associated with lesser odds of being overweight, particularly among high school girls (OR=0.86, p<0.01).

Our goal is to develop and evaluate a discrimination measure that is appropriate for use in surveys of racially and ethnically diverse populations. METHODS: To develop our measure, we employ a mixed-methods approach for survey research, drawing from both qualitative and quantitative traditions, including literature review, cognitive testing, psychometric analyses, behavior coding as well as two rounds of field testing using a split-sample design. We tested our new measure using two different approaches to elicit self-reported experiences of racial/ethnic discrimination. RESULTS: Our new measure captures four dimensions of racial/ethnic discrimination: 1) frequency of encounters with discrimination across several domains (eg, medical care, school, work, street and other public places); 2) timing of exposure (eg recent, lifetime); 3) appraisal of discrimination as stressful; and 4) responses to discrimination.

Minority workplaces are potential venues to provide regular, effective health promotion opportunities to underserved individuals. The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of changing workplace policy, programs, and practices in minority-owned workplaces. METHODS: Four minority Native American-owned businesses were recruited to participate in this study. The intervention was a set of recommended standards and guidelines gleaned from the US Preventive Task Force and The Community Guide relevant to workplaces. Each workplace selected between 4 and 6 target areas to improve over the year-long intervention period. The evaluation tool was a semi-structured survey conducted at baseline and at one-year follow-up, with workplace staff responsible for benefits and services to employees. Feasibility was evaluated by assessing the likelihood that the workplaces implemented health promotion activities in the year-long intervention. RESULTS: Several practices and policies changed significantly during the intervention in the four workplaces, including coverage for nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), elimination of out of pocket costs for screening and tobacco cessation, accountability systems for providers, posted stair use, cessation line availability that included NRT, offering weight loss programs, offering physical activity programs, and conducting targeted communication programs about health promotion. Other practices and polices changed in the expected direction, but were not significant. CONCLUSION: Changing workplace programs, practices, and policies is feasible in minority workplaces, with support and tools provided by outside organizations.

Although the test is simple, implementation requires adherence to specific techniques of testing and follow-up of abnormal results. OBJECTIVE: To examine how FOBT and follow-up are conducted in community practice across the United States. DESIGN: Cross-sectional national surveys of primary care physicians and the public. SETTING: The Survey of Colorectal Cancer Screening Practices in Health Care Organizations and the 2000 National Health Interview Survey. PARTICIPANTS: 1147 primary care physicians who ordered or performed FOBT and 11 365 adults 50 years of age or older who responded to questions about FOBT use. MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported data on details of FOBT implementation and follow-up of positive results. RESULTS: Although screening guidelines recommend home tests, 32.5% (95% CI, 29.8% to 35.3%) of physicians used only the less accurate method of single-sample in-office testing; another 41.2% (CI, 38.3% to 44.0%) used both types of test. Follow-up of positive test results showed considerable nonadherence to guidelines, with 29.7% (CI, 27.1% to 32.4%) of physicians recommending repeating FOBT. Furthermore, sigmoidoscopy, rather than total colon examination, was commonly recommended to work up abnormal findings. Nearly one third of adults who reported having FOBT said they had only an in-office test, and nearly one third of those who reported abnormal FOBT results reported no follow-up diagnostic procedures. Limitations: The study was based on self-reports. Data from the National Health Interview Survey may underestimate the prevalence of in-office testing and inadequate follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality reductions demonstrated with FOBT in clinical trials may not be realized in community practice because of the common use of in-office tests and inappropriate follow-up of positive results.

Stat Med 2015;34(30):4016-4030",2015,A penalized robust semiparametric approach for gene-environment interactions,"In genetic and genomic studies, gene-environment (GxE) interactions have important implications. Some of the existing GxE interaction methods are limited by analyzing a small number of G factors at a time, by assuming linear effects of E factors, by assuming no data contamination, and by adopting ineffective selection techniques. In this study, we propose a new approach for identifying important GxE interactions. It jointly models the effects of all E and G factors and their interactions. A partially linear varying coefficient model is adopted to accommodate possible nonlinear effects of E factors. A rank-based loss function is used to accommodate possible data contamination. Penalization, which has been extensively used with high-dimensional data, is adopted for selection. The proposed penalized estimation approach can automatically determine if a G factor has an interaction with an E factor, main effect but not interaction, or no effect at all. The proposed approach can be effectively realized using a coordinate descent algorithm. Simulation shows that it has satisfactory performance and outperforms several competing alternatives. The proposed approach is used to analyze a lung cancer study with gene expression measurements and clinical variables.

This prospective cohort study at an academic medical center consisted of 162 medical inpatients over age 50 years without delirium upon admission.

An MMSE</=24 carried a 5.5 [95% confidence intervals (CI), 2.7-11.1] relative risk for delirium, whereas cognitive impairment detected by the Mini-cog, D=(MC), or AD8 carried a 2-fold risk. Adding the D=(MC) to the MMSE increased the sensitivity for predicting delirium from 52% (range, 32% to 73%) for the MMSE alone to 65% (range, 46% to 85%) if either test was positive. If both were positive, specificity was maximized at 97% (range, 94% to 100%), but sensitivity was 17% (range, 2% to 33%).

RTLs were not significantly associated with high phobic anxiety symptoms after 16 years of follow-up. However, FMM identified 3 groups of phobic symptoms in later-life: severe, minimal/intermediate, and non-anxious. The severe group had non-significantly shorter multivariable-adjusted mean RTLs than the minimal/intermediate and non-anxious groups. Women with shorter telomeres vs. longest telomeres had non-significantly higher likelihood of being in the severe vs. non-anxious group.

This study explored doctors' perceptions of useful strategies to motivate patients to quit, how receptive they felt patients were to these strategies, and the benefits and drawbacks of discussing smoking cessation with patients. METHODS: Fourteen semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with doctors and resident doctors. RESULTS: Strategies reported by providers included: educating about the health risks of smoking, using 'scare tactics' to highlight the harmful effects and providing advice about how to quit. Providers believed that most patients were receptive to their strategies, but noted that they lacked feedback to know for sure. Providers saw the possibility of improving patients' health and decreasing overall health care costs as potential benefits, but cited the potential to damage rapport, competing priorities during already rushed visits and uncertainty about the effectiveness of their efforts as drawbacks that reduced their motivation to raise the issue with patients. CONCLUSIONS: Doctors believe in the potential benefits of smoking cessation counselling but predominantly report focusing on enhancing patient's risk perceptions. They did not report attempting to use the wider array of recommended and empirically supported methods to counsel their patients. Providing doctors with increased training in motivational counselling and feedback about the efficacy their efforts or supplementing doctor care with behaviour change specialists would likely increase the benefits of counselling to patients.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=24628799,0,0,0,0

Three survey items assessed patients' frequency of encountering ads concerning treatment alternatives for cancer, dealing with side effects of treatment, and doctors or hospitals offering services for cancer following their diagnosis. The analysis showed that overall exposure to DTCA in this study population was modest (median was once per week). Breast cancer patients reported significantly higher exposure to all three ad categories and overall DTCA exposure than prostate and colorectal cancer patients. Older patients consistently reported lower overall exposure to DTCA across the three cancer types. Other significant correlates included ethnicity (higher exposures among African American prostate cancer patients vs. White; lower exposures in Hispanic colorectal cancer patients vs. White) and cancer stage (higher exposures in Stage IV prostate cancer patients vs. Stages 0-II).

METHODS: Prospective survey of men with local stage prostate cancer in 3 geographically separate regions was carried out. Most men were surveyed after diagnosis but before starting therapy. RESULTS: On average, men with local prostate cancer consulted nearly 5 separate sources of information before treatment. The most common source of information was the patient's physician (97%), followed by lay-literature (pamphlets, videos) (76%), other health professionals (71%), friends with prostate cancer (67%), and the Internet (58%). Most men rated the sources they consulted as helpful. Consulting the Internet was associated with considering more treatment options. Several information sources were significantly associated with considering particular treatments, but the magnitude of association was small in relation to patient age, comorbidity, and Gleason score.

OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the accuracy and completeness of Medicare claims data for breast cancer surgery to determine whether Medicare claims can serve as a source of data to augment information collected by cancer registries. METHODS: We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Cancer Registry-Medicare data and compared Medicare claims on surgery with the surgery recorded by the SEER registries for 23,709 women diagnosed with breast cancer at > or =65 years of age from 1991 through 1993. RESULTS: More than 95% of women having mastectomies according to the Medicare data were confirmed by SEER. For breast-conserving surgery, 91% of cases were confirmed by SEER. The Medicare physician services claims and inpatient claims were approximately equal in accuracy on type of surgery. The Medicare outpatient claims were less accurate for breast-conserving surgery. In terms of completeness, when the 3 claims sources were combined, 94% of patients receiving breast cancer surgery according to SEER were identified by Medicare. CONCLUSIONS: The combined Medicare claims database, which includes the inpatient, outpatient, and physician service claims, provides valid information on surgical treatment among women known to have breast cancer.

We investigated the relationship of radiologist characteristics to actual performance from 1996 to 2001. METHODS: Screening mammograms (n = 469,512) interpreted by 124 radiologists were linked to cancer outcome data. The radiologists completed a survey that included questions on demographics, malpractice concerns, years of experience interpreting mammograms, and the number of mammograms read annually. We used receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis to analyze variables associated with sensitivity, specificity, and the combination of the two, adjusting for patient variables that affect performance. All P values are two-sided. RESULTS: Within 1 year of the mammogram, 2402 breast cancers were identified. Relative to low annual interpretive volume (< or =1000 mammograms), greater interpretive volume was associated with higher sensitivity (P = .001; odds ratio [OR] for moderate volume [1001-2000] = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.18 to 2.39; OR for high volume [>2000] = 1.89, 95% CI = 1.36 to 2.63).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this institutional review board-approved HIPAA-compliant study, sensitivity, specificity, and cancer detection rate of 387,218 screening mammograms linked to 1283 breast cancers in premenopausal women according to week of menstrual cycle were studied by using prospectively collected information from the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. Logistic regression analysis was used to test for differences in mammography performance according to week of menstrual cycle, adjusting for age and registry. RESULTS: Overall, screening mammography performance did not differ according to week of menstrual cycle. However, when analyses were subdivided according to prior mammography, different patterns emerged. For the 66.6% of women who had undergone regular screening (mammography had been performed within the past 2 years), sensitivity was higher in week 1 (79.5%) than in subsequent weeks (week 2, 70.3%; week 3, 67.4%; week 4, 73.0%; P = .041). In the 17.8% of women who underwent mammography for the first time in this study, sensitivity tended to be lower during the follicular phase (week 1, 72.1%; week 2, 80.4%; week 3, 84.6%; week 4, 93.8%; P = .051). Sensitivity did not vary significantly by week in menstrual cycle in women who had undergone mammography more than 3 years earlier. There were no clinically meaningful differences in specificity or cancer detection rate. Conclusion: Premenopausal women who undergo regular screening may benefit from higher sensitivity of mammography if they schedule screening mammography during the 1st week of their menstrual cycle.

We included 24,631 women with and 463,804 women without a prior diagnosis of breast cancer who completed a questionnaire (including breast cancer history) at participating US mammography facilities between 1996 and 2006. We determined 'true' cancer status using cancer registries and pathology databases. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine associations with patient factors and pathologic findings. Sensitivity of self-reported breast cancer was higher for women with invasive cancer (96.9%) than for those with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) (90.2%). Specificity was high overall (99.7%) but much lower for women with a history of lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) (65.0%). In multivariable models, women reporting older ages, a nonwhite race/ethnicity, or less education had lower sensitivities and specificities. Sensitivity was reduced when there was evidence of prior DCIS, especially when this diagnosis had been made more than 2 years before questionnaire completion. Women reporting a family history of breast cancer had higher sensitivity. Evidence of prior LCIS was associated with lower specificity. The accuracy of self-reported breast cancer depends on the respondent's characteristics and prior diagnoses. Accuracy is lower among nonwhite women and women reporting less education.

Nicotine withdrawal exacerbates cognitive and attentional problems and may be one factor in smoking relapse. The startle reflex response and prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the response are sensitive to arousal and early attentional dysregulation. The current study examined whether startle response and PPI are related to early smoking lapse, and if this differs in people with and without posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Participants with (N = 34) and without (N = 57) PTSD completed a startle reflex and PPI assessment during (1) ad lib smoking (2) on the first day of abstinence during a quit attempt. Most (88%) participants lapsed within the first week of the quit attempt. PTSD status predicted shorter time to lapse. Larger startle magnitude and greater PPI predicted a longer duration before smoking lapse. When diagnostic groups were examined separately, greater PPI predicted a longer successful quit attempt only in participants with a PTSD diagnosis. The startle reflex response and PPI may provide an objective, neurophysiological evaluation of regulation of arousal and early attentional processes by nicotine, which are important factors in smoking cessation success.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26253620,1,0,1,0

METHODS: National survey of surgeons and medical oncologists caring for patients with colorectal cancer regarding whether they would recommend adjuvant chemotherapy for hypothetical patients with stage III colon cancer who varied by age (55 v 80 years) and comorbid illness (none, moderate, severe congestive heart failure [CHF]). Repeated measures logistic regression was used to assess the influence of patient, physician, and practice characteristics on chemotherapy recommendations. RESULTS: Of 1,096 physicians, nearly all recommended chemotherapy for patients who were 55 years old with no comorbidity (99.0%), 55-years old with moderate CHF (88.6%), or 80 years old with no comorbidity (92.6%); many fewer recommended chemotherapy for 55-year-old patients with severe CHF (24.9%) or 80-year-old patients with moderate (47.2%) or severe (9.0%) CHF (P < .001). Younger physicians (P < .001) were more likely than others to recommend adjuvant chemotherapy overall, although physician factors explained little of the variability in recommendations.

For older and sicker patients, the individual physicians seen may have a substantial impact on the likelihood of receiving chemotherapy. Understanding better the sources of variation not explained by patients' clinical characteristics may allow improved tailoring of therapy to patients most likely to benefit.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Colon, Digestive Organs","Outcomes Research, Health Services and Economics Branch, Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Progra, Surveillance Research Program, Applied Research Program",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=18487570,0,0,0,0

Age differences in everyday stressor-related negative affect: a coordinated analysis. Psychol Aging 2019;34(1):91-105",2019,Age differences in everyday stressor-related negative affect: a coordinated analysis,"Advancing age is often characterized by preserved or even enhanced emotion regulation, which is thought to manifest in terms of age-related reductions in the within-person association between stressors and negative affect. Existing research from ecological momentary assessment and end-of-day daily diary studies examining such age-related benefits have yielded mixed results, potentially due to differences in samples, design, and measurement of everyday stressors and negative affect. We conducted a coordinated analysis of 5 ecological momentary assessments and 2 end-of-day daily diary studies to examine adult age differences in the within-person association between everyday stressors and negative affect. Reported stressor occurrences are robustly associated with higher negative affect, regardless of study design and sample characteristics. Across studies, interactions between age and everyday stressors predicting negative affect revealed a pattern of age-related decreases in the stressor-negative affect association, but this interaction was only significant for 2 studies. Further, examination of statistical power of the included studies suggests that, despite differences in the number of repeated assessments, power to detect within-person stressor-negative affect associations is quite good. In contrast, despite possessing wider age ranges, observed age differences were relatively small in magnitude, and studies are potentially underpowered to detect age differences in these within-person associations. We discuss the importance of study design, interval of repeated assessments and number of participants for examining age differences in everyday stressors and negative affect, as well as the virtue of coordinated analyses for detecting consistent direction of associations, but inconsistent patterns of statistical significance.

Horm Cancer 2015;6:237-246",2015,Alcohol consumption and risk of breast cancer by tumor receptor expression,"In epidemiologic studies, alcohol consumption appears more strongly associated with risk of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive than ER-negative breast cancer. However, this association has not been assessed by other potentially relevant tumor markers, such as androgen receptor (AR) or insulin receptor (IR). In the prospective Nurses' Health Study cohort, we evaluated alcohol consumption and breast cancer risk by individual tumor marker expression (i.e., ER, progesterone receptor [PR], AR, and IR) while controlling for other markers and also assessed the joint effect of these receptors. During 26 years follow-up of 106,037 women, 2552 invasive breast cancers contributed to the analysis. When all four markers were considered simultaneously, no significant heterogeneity of the alcohol and breast cancer association was observed by any of the markers. However, each increment in one drink per day was associated with 10% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 4%, 15%) and 9% (95% CI = 4%, 15%) increased risk of AR-positive and ER-positive breast cancer, respectively, while no increased risk was observed among AR-negative or ER-negative tumors. The association was independent of PR and IR expression. Assessment of the joint expression of hormone receptors revealed a significantly increased risk among AR+/ER+/PR+ (hazard ratio [HR] per drink/day = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.06, 1.17) but not in other subgroups (e.g. , AR-/ER-/PR-: HR = 0.99; 95% CI = 0.88, 1.12).

Addict Behav 2015;51:177-183",2015,All physical activity may not be associated with a lower likelihood of adolescent smoking uptake,"OBJECTIVE: Research has documented that physical activity is associated with a lower risk of adolescent smoking uptake, yet it is unclear whether this relationship exists for all types of physical activity. We sought to determine whether certain types of physical activity are associated with a decreased or an increased risk of adolescent smoking uptake. METHODS: In this longitudinal cohort study, adolescents (n=1356) were surveyed every six months for four years (age 14-18years old). Smoking and physical activity were measured at each of the eight time-points. Physical activity that was negatively associated with smoking across the eight waves was considered positive physical activities (i.e., PPA; linked to not smoking such as racquet sports, running, and swimming laps). Physical activity that was positively associated with smoking across the eight waves were considered negative physical activities (i.e., NPA; linked to smoking such as skating, walking, bicycling, sport fighting, and competitive wrestling). RESULTS: Associative Processes Latent Growth Curve Modeling revealed that each 30-minute increase in NPA per week at baseline was associated with a 4-fold increased odds of smoking progression (OR=4.10, 95% CI=2.14, 7.83). By contrast, each 30-minute increase in PPA at baseline was associated with a 51% decrease in the odds of smoking progression (OR=.49, 95% CI=.25, .93). CONCLUSIONS: The type of physical activity that an adolescent engages appears to be important for the uptake of cigarette smoking among adolescents. These associative relationships warrant consideration in interventions to increase overall physical activity and those promoting physical activity to prevent smoking uptake.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26280377,0,0,0,0

Chromosomal instable (CIN) colon cancers are thought to be the most common type of colon cancer. The risk of developing a CIN-related CRC is due in part to inherited risk factors. Genome-wide association studies have yielded over 40 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with CRC risk, but these only account for a subset of risk alleles. Some of this missing heritability may be due to gene-gene interactions. We developed a strategy to identify interacting candidate genes/loci for CRC risk that utilizes both linkage and RNA-seq data from mouse models in combination with allele-specific imbalance (ASI) studies in human tumors. We applied our strategy to three previously identified CRC susceptibility loci in the mouse that show evidence of genetic interaction: Scc4, Scc5 and Scc13. 525 SNPs from genes showing differential expression in the mouse and/or a previous role in cancer from the literature were evaluated for allele-specific imbalance in 194 paired human normal/tumor DNAs from CIN-related CRCs. One hundred three SNPs showing suggestive evidence of ASI (31 variants with uncorrected p values < 0.05) were genotyped in a validation set of 296 paired DNAs. Two variants in SNX10 (SCC13) showed significant evidence of allelic selection after multiple comparisons testing.

Theory-based intervention approaches have identified self-efficacy as a potential mediator of PA intervention. This study examines the temporal relationships at 4 time points (T1-T4) between several social-cognitive theory constructs and PA among a group of endometrial cancer survivors receiving PA intervention. METHOD: A sample of 98 sedentary women who were at least 6 months posttreatment for endometrial cancer were given interventions to increase their PA. We tested whether modeling, physiological somatic sensations, and social support at previous time points predicted self-efficacy at later time points, which in turn would predict PA at later time points. RESULTS: Results indicated that, as physiological somatic sensations at T2 decreased, self-efficacy at T3 increased, which led to an increase in PA at T4. This suggests that self-efficacy is a significant mediator between physiological somatic sensations and PA. Exploratory follow-up models suggest that model fit can be improved with the addition of contemporaneous effects between self-efficacy and PA at T3 and T4, changing the timing of the mediational relationships. CONCLUSION: Physiological somatic sensations appear to be an important construct to target to increase PA in this population. Self-efficacy appeared to mediate the relationship between physiological somatic sensations and PA, but the timing of this relationship requires further study.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between use of antibiotics and risk of breast cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Case-control study among 2266 women older than 19 years with primary, invasive breast cancer (cases) enrolled in a large, nonprofit health plan for at least 1 year between January 1, 1993, and June 30, 2001, and 7953 randomly selected female health plan members (controls), frequency-matched to cases on age and length of enrollment. Cases were ascertained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registry. Antibiotic use was ascertained from computerized pharmacy records. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Association between extent of antibiotic use and risk of breast cancer. RESULTS: Increasing cumulative days of antibiotic use were associated with increased risk of incident breast cancer, adjusted for age and length of enrollment. For categories of increasing use (0, 1-50, 51-100, 101-500, 501-1000, and > or =1001 days), odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for breast cancer were 1.00 (reference), 1.45 (1.24-1.69), 1.53 (1.28-1.83), 1.68 (1.42-2.00), 2.14 (1.60-2.88), and 2.07 (1.48-2.89) (P<.001 for trend). Increased risk was observed in all antibiotic classes studied and in a subanalysis having breast cancer fatality as the outcome. Among women with the highest levels of tetracycline or macrolide use, risk of breast cancer was not elevated in those using these antibiotics exclusively for acne or rosacea (indications that could be risk factors for breast cancer due to altered hormone levels), compared with those using them exclusively for respiratory tract infections, adjusted for age and length of enrollment (odds ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.44-1.87). CONCLUSIONS: Use of antibiotics is associated with increased risk of incident and fatal breast cancer.

We show that this time-varying usual intake model fits the data better than the fixed usual intake assumption. Using this model, we estimated attenuation factors and correlations with true longer-term usual intake for single and multiple 24-hour dietary recalls (24HRs) and food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) and compared them with those obtained under the ""fixed"" method. Compared with the fixed method, the estimates using the time-varying model showed slightly larger values of the attenuation factor and correlation coefficient for FFQs and smaller values for 24HRs. In some cases, the difference between the fixed method estimate and the new estimate for multiple 24HRs was substantial. With the new method, while four 24HRs had higher estimated correlations with truth than a single FFQ for absolute intakes of protein, potassium, and sodium, for densities the correlations were approximately equal. Accounting for the time element in dietary validation is potentially important, and points toward the need for longer-term validation studies.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26360372,0,0,0,0

Although primary care physicians' recommendations to their patients are central to the screening process, little information is available about their recommendations in relation to guidelines for the menu of CRC screening modalities, including fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS), colonoscopy, and double contrast barium enema (DCBE). The objective of this study was to explore potentially modifiable physician and practice factors associated with guideline-consistent recommendations for the menu of CRC screening modalities. METHODS: We examined data from a nationally representative sample of 1266 physicians in the U.S. surveyed in 2007. The survey included questions about physician and practice characteristics, perceptions about screening, and recommendations for age of initiation and screening interval for FOBT, FS, colonoscopy and DCBE in average risk adults. Physicians' screening recommendations were classified as guideline consistent for all, some, or none of the CRC screening modalities recommended. Analyses used descriptive statistics and polytomous logit regression models. RESULTS: Few (19.1%; 95% CI:16.9%, 21.5%) physicians made guideline-consistent recommendations across all CRC screening modalities that they recommended. In multivariate analysis, younger physician age, board certification, north central geographic region, single specialty or multi-specialty practice type, fewer patients per week, higher number of recommended modalities, use of electronic medical records, greater influence of patient preferences for screening, and published clinical evidence were associated with guideline-consistent screening recommendations (p < 0.05).

Although aromatase inhibitors reduce breast cancer incidence, their influence on endometrial cancer is uncertain. METHODS: The authors investigated this issue in a cohort of 17,064 women who were diagnosed with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer in an integrated group practice health plan. Information on demographics, comorbidities, and the receipt of adjuvant endocrine therapy was available from electronic medical records and pharmacy records, respectively. Endometrial cancer information was obtained from the health plan's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-affiliated tumor registry, and rates were compared across endocrine therapy groups (aromatase inhibitor, n = 5303; tamoxifen, n = 5155; switchers: both [n = 3787] or none [n = 2819]) using multivariable adjusted Cox proportional-hazards models. RESULTS: Endometrial cancer incidence was a statistically significant 48% lower in the aromatase inhibitor group versus the tamoxifen group (hazard ratio, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-0.87; P = .01). Endometrial cancer incidence was 29% lower in the aromatase inhibitor group versus the no endocrine therapy group (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.37-1.35; P = .30) and 33% lower in the aromatase inhibitor group versus the tamoxifen group (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.42-1.06; P = .08), but neither difference was statistically significant. Associations were stronger among those with good drug adherence. CONCLUSIONS: In a community-based, integrated health plan setting, endometrial cancer incidence was lower in women who were receiving an aromatase inhibitor compared with those who were receiving tamoxifen.

Sci Transl Med 2014;6(233)",2014,Aspirin and the risk of colorectal cancer in relation to the expression of 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (HPGD),"Aspirin use reduces the risk of colorectal neoplasia, at least in part, through inhibition of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2, cyclooxygenase 2)-related pathways. Hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase 15-(nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) (15-PGDH, HPGD) is down-regulated in colorectal cancers and functions as a metabolic antagonist of PTGS2. We hypothesized that the effect of aspirin may be antagonized by low 15-PGDH expression in the normal colon. In the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, we collected data on aspirin use every 2 years and followed up participants for diagnoses of colorectal cancer. Duplication-method Cox proportional, multivariable-adjusted, cause-specific hazards regression for competing risks data was used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) for incident colorectal cancer according to 15-PGDH mRNA expression level measured in normal mucosa from colorectal cancer resections. Among 127,865 participants, we documented 270 colorectal cancer cases from which we could assess 15-PGDH expression. Compared with nonuse, regular aspirin use was associated with lower risk of colorectal cancer that developed within a background of colonic mucosa with high 15-PGDH expression [multivariable HR, 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.34 to 0.71], but not with low 15-PGDH expression (multivariable HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.63 to 1.27) (P for heterogeneity = 0.018). Regular aspirin use was associated with lower incidence of colorectal cancers arising in association with high 15-PGDH expression, but not with low 15-PGDH expression in normal colon mucosa. This suggests that 15-PGDH expression level in normal colon mucosa may serve as a biomarker that may predict stronger benefit from aspirin chemoprevention.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Colon, Colorectal, Digestive Organs",Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=24760190,0,1,0,0

An experimental study examined a novel approach for presenting accurate constituent information about brands and types of smokeless tobacco (SLT) that could be understood by the general public. METHODS: Participants were recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk and presented information online about 2 constituent dimensions of SLT products-nicotine and/or toxicity (for simplicity, ""toxicity"" in this study refers to carcinogenic constituents) Participants completed measures of knowledge and tobacco health risks at 2 time points: before and after exposure to constituent information. RESULTS: Participants were found to increase their knowledge that toxicity contributes to disease risk and nicotine contributes to addiction, that SLT products vary in their levels of nicotine and toxicity, and that both SLT and cigarette products have higher toxicity than medicinal nicotine replacement therapies (e.g., nicotine lozenges). Study results showed no differences when presenting toxicity information alone versus presenting it in conjunction with nicotine information, and found no misperceptions or confusions about the relative harmfulness of cigarettes, SLT, or nicotine replacement therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Providing tobacco constituent information to smokers and nonsmokers will improve their knowledge about the relative toxicity across products and variations within a class of tobacco products without compromising the health risks associated with tobacco use.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=25634934,0,0,0,0

C-statistics and Hosmer-Lemeshow tests were used to evaluate discrimination and calibration. Ten-fold cross-validation was used for internal validation. A total of 330 (6.7%) men and 678 (3.8%) women were diagnosed with high-risk adenoma at first-time screening colonoscopy. The model for men included age, family history of colorectal cancer, BMI, smoking, sitting watching TV/VCR, regular aspirin/NSAID use, physical activity, and a joint term of multivitamin and alcohol. For women, the model included age, family history of colorectal cancer, BMI, smoking, alcohol, beef/pork/lamb as main dish, regular aspirin/NSAID, calcium, and oral contraceptive use.

This clinical information is often unavailable and when it is available its observational nature can cause analytic problems. Problems with clinical data have led some researchers to evaluate mammographers using a single set of films. Research based on these test film sets implicitly assumes a correspondence between mammographers' accuracy in the test setting and their accuracy in a clinical setting. However, there is no evidence supporting this basic assumption. In this article we use hierarchical models and data from 27 mammographers to directly compare accuracy estimated from clinical practice data to accuracy estimated from a test film set. We found moderate positive correlation [ rho; = 0.206 with 95% credible interval (-0.142-0. 488)] between mammographers' overall preponderance to call a mammogram positive. However, we found no evidence of correlation between clinical and test accuracy [ rho; = -0.025 with 95% credible interval (-0.484-0.447)].

Effective communication can help patients and family members cope with cancer, make informed decisions, and effectively manage their care; suboptimal communication can contribute to care breakdowns and undermine clinician-patient relationships. The study purpose was to explore stakeholders' views on the feasibility and acceptability of collecting self-reported patient and family perceptions of communication experiences while receiving cancer care. The results were intended to inform the design, development, and implementation of a structured and generalizable patient-level reporting system. METHODS: This was a formative, qualitative study that used semistructured interviews with cancer patients, family members, clinicians, and leaders of health care organizations. The constant comparative method was used to identify major themes in the interview transcripts. RESULTS: A total of 106 stakeholders were interviewed. Thematic saturation was achieved. All stakeholders recognized the importance of communication and endorsed efforts to improve communication during cancer care. Patients, clinicians, and leaders expressed concerns about the potential consequences of reports of suboptimal communication experiences, such as damage to the clinician-patient relationship, and the need for effective improvement strategies. Patients and family members would report good communication experiences in order to encourage such practices. Practical and logistic issues were identified. CONCLUSION: Patient reports of their communication experiences during cancer care could increase understanding of the communication process, stimulate improvements, inform interventions, and provide a basis for evaluating changes in communication practices.

The dataset included fully-anonymized mammograms acquired on 870 women with two sequential full-field digital mammography examinations. For each woman, the first ""prior"" examination in the series was interpreted as negative (not recalled) during the original image reading. In the second ""current"" examination, 430 women were diagnosed with pathology verified cancers and 440 remained negative (""cancer-free""). For each of four bilateral craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique view images of left and right breasts, we computed and analyzed eight groups of global mammographic texture and tissue density image features. A risk prediction model based on three artificial neural networks was developed to fuse image features computed from two bilateral views of four images. The risk model performance was tested using a ten-fold cross-validation method and a number of performance evaluation indices including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and odds ratio (OR). The highest AUC = 0.725 +/- 0.026 was obtained when the model was trained by gray-level run length statistics texture features computed on dense breast regions, which was significantly higher than the AUC values achieved using the model trained by only two bilateral one-view images (p < 0.02). The adjustable OR values monotonically increased from 1.0 to 11.8 as model-generated risk score increased. The regression analysis of OR values also showed a significant increase trend in slope (p < 0.01). As a result, this preliminary study demonstrated that a new four-view mammographic image feature based risk model could provide useful and supplementary image information to help predict the near-term breast cancer risk.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Breast,Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=25851469,0,0,0,0

METHODS: We surveyed a population-based cohort of leukemia, bladder, and colorectal cancer survivors diagnosed 2 to 5 years previously in northern California (N = 623; participation rate, 69.2%; overall response rate, 49.2%). Data were collected between April 2003 and November 2004. Ten scales assessed survivors' perceptions of different aspects of care in the last 12 months, and an eleventh scale measured their overall ratings of care. RESULTS: On nine of the 11 scales, mean scores ranged from 88 to 97 on a 0 to 100 response format, indicating very positive experiences. The two areas where quality perceptions were lower were discussions about health promotion and the physician's knowledge of the whole patient. In adjusted analyses, those without private health insurance (P = .02) and Hispanic and Asian survivors compared with whites (P < .001) reported worse timeliness of care.

Length of the patient-physician relationship was the variable most consistently found to be significantly associated with survivors' quality assessments. Physicians' information exchange had the strongest relationship with overall ratings of care, followed by physicians' affective behavior, their knowledge of the survivor, and survivors' perceptions of coordination of care (P < .001 for all).

METHODS: We linked data from the National Health Interview Survey on the use of colorectal cancer screening by respondents aged 50 years or older, by hospital-referral region, with data from the Survey of Colorectal Cancer Screening Practices on the colorectal cancer screening recommendations of primary care physicians, by region. Our principal independent variables were the proportion of physicians in a region who recommended screening at age 50 and continuing screening at the recommended frequency. RESULTS: On average, 53.3% of physicians in a region correctly recommended initiating colorectal cancer screening, and 64.8% advised screening at the recommended frequency. Of adults who lived in regions where less than 30% of physicians correctly recommended initiating screening, 47.3% had been screened, in contrast to 54.8% in areas where 70% or more of physicians made correct recommendations. Seventy-one percent of respondents living in regions where less than 30% of physicians advised screening at the recommended frequency were current on screening, in contrast to 79.9% of respondents living in regions where 70% or more of physicians made this recommendation.

METHODS: We examined subtypes in 629 women with invasive BC, diagnosed from 2006 to 2012, and enrolled in an epidemiological study in New Jersey. Using molecular characteristics from pathology reports, BCs were categorized as luminal A, luminal B, non-luminal HER2-expressing, or triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtypes. Multinomial logistic models (luminal A as referent) were used to describe BC subtype associations. RESULTS: Women with luminal B tumors were more likely to be younger at diagnosis [odds ratio (OR) 1.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0-3.4] and to have higher-grade (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.5-4.7), larger (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.0-3.6), and Ki67-positive tumors (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-4.0). Women with non-luminal HER2-expressing BCs were more likely to have higher-grade tumors (OR 14.5, 95% CI 5.3-39.7). Women with TNBCs were more likely to be African-American (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.0-3.4) and to have higher-grade (OR 9.7, 95% CI 5.1-18.4), larger (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.0-4.8), and Ki67-positive (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.6-5.2) tumors. Notably, compared to the luminal A subtype, luminal B, non-luminal HER2-expressing, and triple-negative subtypes were more frequently self-detected; however, these associations were attenuated in multivariable models. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that some BC subtypes were associated with features denoting more aggressive phenotypes, namely higher grade, larger size, and Ki67 positivity, and possibly patient self-detection among some women.

No associations were observed between any of the genotypes and sex hormones when analyzing the main effects. In subgroup analyses, androgen levels of Hispanic women with the variant (A2) CYP17 genotype were 46-87% higher than those of women with the wild-type; androgen levels were 13-20% lower in non-Hispanic whites with the variant genotype; no difference by genotype was observed for African-American women.

RESULTS: Increasing HOMA scores were associated with reduced breast cancer survival (hazard ratio [HR], 1.12; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.20) and reduced all-cause survival (HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.15) after adjustment for possible confounders. Higher levels of adiponectin (above the median: 15.5 mug/mL) were associated with longer breast cancer survival (HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.95) after adjustment for covariates. A continuous measure of adiponectin was not associated with either breast cancer-specific or all-cause mortality. CONCLUSION: Elevated HOMA scores and low levels of adiponectin, both associated with obesity, were associated with increased breast cancer mortality. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the association between low levels of adiponectin and increased breast cancer mortality in breast cancer survivors","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Breast,"Office of the Associate Director, Behavioral Research Program, Applied Research Program",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=21115858,0,0,0,0

However, its association with breast cancer survival is not established. Circulating concentrations of IGF-1 are controlled via binding proteins, including IGF Binding Protein-3 (IGFBP-3), that may modulate the association of IGF-1 with breast-cancer outcomes. We measured IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 concentrations in serum from 600 women enrolled in the health, eating, activity, and lifestyle (HEAL) study, a multiethnic, prospective cohort study of women diagnosed with stage I-IIIA breast cancer. We evaluated the association between IGF-1 and IGFBP-3, and as a ratio, modeled using quintile cut-points, with risk of breast cancer-specific (n = 42 deaths) and all-cause mortality (n = 87 deaths) using Cox proportional hazards models. In models adjusted for body mass index, ethnicity, tamoxifen use at time of blood draw, treatment received at diagnosis and IGFBP-3, women in the highest quintile of IGF-1 level had an increased risk of all-cause mortality (Hazard Ratio (HR) = 3.10, 95% CI 1.21-7.93, p = 0.02), although no dose-response association was evident. The IGF-1/IGFBP-3 ratio, an indicator of free IGF-I levels, was significantly associated with increasing risk of all-cause mortality (HR = 2.83, 95% CI 1.25-6.36 p(trend) = 0.01, upper vs. lower quintile) in a fully adjusted model.

Med Sci Sports Exerc 2018;50(12):2575-2583",2018,Associations of sedentary time with energy expenditure and anthropometric measures,"PURPOSE: To investigate associations between accelerometer-determined sedentary time (ST) in prolonged (>/=30 min) and nonprolonged (<30 min) bouts with physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) from doubly labeled water. Additionally, associations between ST and body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference were examined. METHODS: Data from 736 women and 655 men age 43 to 82 yr were analyzed. Participants wore the Actigraph GT3X for 7 d on two occasions approximately 6 months apart, and the average of the measurements was used. Physical activity energy expenditure was estimated by subtracting resting metabolic rate and the thermic effect of food from doubly labeled water estimates of total daily energy expenditure. Cross-sectional associations were analyzed using isotemporal substitution modeling. RESULTS: Reallocation of prolonged ST to nonprolonged was not associated with increased PAEE and only significantly associated with lower BMI (beta = -0.57 kg.m; 95% confidence interval, -0.94 to -0.20) and waist circumference (beta = -1.61 cm; 95% confidence interval, -2.61 to -0.60) in men. Replacing either type of ST with light or moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was significantly associated with higher PAEE, and lower BMI and waist circumference in both women and men. CONCLUSIONS: Limiting time spent sedentary as well as decreasing ST accumulated in prolonged bouts may have beneficial effects on BMI and waist circumference. Replacing any type of ST with activities of light or higher intensity may also have a substantial impact on PAEE.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=30048408,0,0,0,0

Cancer Causes Control 2013;24(4):759-767",2013,Associations of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D with overall and breast cancer-specific mortality in a multiethnic cohort of breast cancer survivors,"PURPOSE: Despite limited evidence on the association of vitamin D with outcomes in breast cancer survivors, some clinicians advise breast cancer patients to use vitamin D supplements. More evidence is needed to inform these recommendations. METHODS: In the Health, Eating, Activity, and Lifestyle study, we examined associations of post-treatment serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) on overall and breast cancer-specific mortality in 585 breast cancer survivors from western Washington State, New Mexico, and Los Angeles County. 25(OH)D was measured in stored blood collected 2 years post-enrollment. Outcomes were ascertained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries and medical records. Cox proportional hazards models were fit to assess associations of serum 25(OH)D with overall and breast cancer-specific mortality. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 9.2 years; 110 women died, including 48 from breast cancer. Standard cut points classified 211 (31.6 %) women as serum 25(OH)D deficient (<20 ng/mL), 189 (32.2 %) as insufficient (20-30 ng/mL), and 185 (36.2 %) as sufficient (>30 ng/mL). Compared to women with deficient 25(OH)D, those in the sufficient ranges had a decreased risk of overall mortality (age-adjusted HR = 0.58; 95 % CI 0.36-0.96); however, multivariate adjustments attenuated the association (HR = 0.90; 95 % CI 0.50-1.61). No association was found between serum 25(OH)D and breast cancer-specific mortality (sufficient: HR = 1.21; 95 % CI 0.52-2.80) in multivariate models. CONCLUSION: In this breast cancer cohort, higher serum 25(OH)D may be associated with improved survival, but results were not statistically significant and must be interpreted with caution.

Serum levels of adiponectin and leptin are deregulated in obese states and are implicated as putative mediators in the pathophysiology of esophageal columnar metaplasia. We describe associations between serum adiponectin and leptin levels with BE. METHODS: Patients were recruited prospectively for a case-control study. Fasting serum levels of adiponectin and leptin were measured in 135 patients with BE and compared with 2 separate control groups: 133 subjects with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and 1157 colon screening controls. RESULTS: Multivariate analyses adjusted for age, race, and waist-to-hip ratio showed that patients within the highest tertile of serum adiponectin level had decreased odds of BE compared with screening colonoscopy controls (odds ratio [OR], 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22-0.80). This effect was more pronounced in men (OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.17-0.74) compared with women (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.17-3.03). In comparisons of BE cases with GERD controls, subjects within the highest tertile of serum adiponectin level showed decreased odds of BE (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.31-1.36), however, this was not statistically significant. Patients in the highest tertile of serum leptin level did not have a significantly increased risk of BE in comparison with GERD (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.61-2.88) or screening colonoscopy controls (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 0.82-3.04) in analyses including both sexes. Based on sex-specific analyses, sex did not significantly alter the association of leptin with odds of BE. CONCLUSIONS: Serum adiponectin was associated inversely with BE and this effect was more pronounced in men, whereas serum leptin showed no evidence of association with BE in comparisons with multiple control groups. The exact mechanism, if any, by which these adipokines promote metaplasia in the esophagus needs to be explored further.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Esophagus, Digestive Organs",Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=25737442,0,1,0,0

METHODS: 1350 clinic patients were assigned to complete a detailed behavioural survey on sexual risk practices, previous STIs and symptoms, condom use, and drug and alcohol use using either ACASI or IAQ. RESULTS: Respondents assigned to ACASI were more likely to report recent risk behaviours such as sex without a condom in the past 24 hours (adjusted OR = 1.9), anal sex (adjusted OR = 2.0), and one or more new partners in the past 6 months (adjusted OR = 1.5) compared to those interviewed by IAQ. The impact of ACASI varied by sex but, contrary to expectations, not by whether the patient had previously visited an STI clinic. Mode of survey administration made little difference within this population in reports of STI knowledge, previous STIs, STI symptoms, or illicit drug use. CONCLUSION: ACASI provides a useful tool for improving the quality of behavioural data in clinical environments.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,"Office of the Associate Director, Applied Research Program",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=16326855,0,0,0,0

Using longitudinal data from the Australian arm of the ITC Four Country Survey, we examined attitudes to the new packs before and after implementation, predictors of attitudinal change, and the relationship between support and quitting activity. METHODS: A population-based cohort study design, with some cross-sectional analyses. Surveys of Australian smokers assessed attitudes to PP at four time points prior to implementation (from 2007 to 2012) and one post-implementation wave collected (early/mid-2013). RESULTS: Trend analysis showed a slight rise in opposition to PP among smokers in the waves leading up to their implementation, but no change in support. Support for PP increased significantly after implementation (28.2% pre vs 49% post), such that post-PP more smokers were supportive than opposed (49% vs 34.7%). Multivariate analysis showed support either before or after implementation was predicted by belief in greater adverse health impacts of smoking, desire to quit and lower addiction. Among those not supportive before implementation, having no clear opinion about PP (versus being opposed) prior to the changes also predicted support post-implementation. Support for PP was prospectively associated with higher levels of quitting activity. CONCLUSIONS: Since implementation of PP along with larger warnings, support among Australian smokers has increased. Support is related to lower addiction, stronger beliefs in the negative health impacts of smoking, and higher levels of quitting activity.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=25385449,0,0,0,0

Am J Prev Med 2017;52(6):863-871",2017,Autonomous motivation and fruit/vegetable intake in parent-adolescent dyads,"INTRODUCTION: Autonomous motivation (motivation to engage in a behavior because of personal choice, interest, or value) is often associated with health behaviors. The present study contributes to research on motivation and eating behaviors by examining (1) how autonomous motivation is correlated within parent-adolescent dyads and (2) whether parent- and adolescent-reported autonomous motivation predicts the parent-adolescent correlation in fruit and vegetable (FV) intake frequency. METHODS: Data were drawn from the Family Life, Activity, Sun, Health, and Eating (FLASHE) Study, a cross-sectional U.S. survey of parent-adolescent dyads led by the National Cancer Institute and fielded between April and October 2014. In 2016, data were analyzed from dyads who had responses on a six-item self-report measure of daily frequency of FV consumption and a two-item self-report measure of autonomous motivation for consuming FVs. RESULTS: Parents' and adolescents' reports of autonomous motivation and FV intake frequency were positively correlated. Both parents' and adolescents' autonomous motivation predicted higher levels of their own FV intake frequency and that of their dyad partner (p-values </=0.001). These effects of autonomous motivation explained 22.6% of the parent-adolescent correlation in FV intake frequency. Actor effects (one's motivation predicting their own FV intake frequency) were stronger than partner effects (one's motivation predicting their partner's FV intake frequency). CONCLUSIONS: Parent-adolescent similarity in autonomous motivation for healthy eating may contribute to similarity in eating behaviors. Future research should further examine how individual-level health behavior correlates influence health behaviors within dyads.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=28526363,0,0,0,0

OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between the potential exposure to newspaper coverage and subsequent hormone therapy (HT) use. DESIGN/POPULATION: Population-based cohort of women receiving mammography at 7 sites (327,144 postmenopausal women). MEASUREMENTS: The outcome was the monthly prevalence of self-reported HT use. Circulation data for local, regional, and national newspapers was used to create zip-code level measures of the estimated average household exposure to newspaper coverage that reported the harmful effects of HT in July 2002. RESULTS: Women had an average potential household exposure of 1.4 articles. There was substantial variation in the level of average household exposure to newspaper coverage; women from rural sites received less than women from urban sites.

The recommendation changes were highly controversial and created conflicting recommendations across professional organizations. This study examines overall awareness of the changes, accuracy of knowledge about changes, factors related to both overall awareness and accuracy, sources of knowledge about changes, and attitudes about the new recommendations. METHOD: National telephone survey of 508 women, half aged 40-49 and half 50+, conducted one year after the update (November/December 2010; cooperation rate was 36%). Measures include awareness, accuracy, source of knowledge, interactions with providers, and attitudes about the changes. RESULTS: Fewer than half of women were aware of the guideline changes. Younger, more educated, and higher income women were more aware. Of those who were aware, only 12% correctly reported both change in age and frequency. Accuracy was not associated with demographics. The majority learned of changes through the media and the majority had negative attitudes about the changes.

Tob Control 2015;24",2015,Banning cigarette smoking on US Navy submarines: a case study,"BACKGROUND: The military has had a long pro-tobacco tradition. Despite official policy discouraging smoking, tobacco still is widely seen as part of military culture. While active smoking has presented a particular challenge for the military, in recent years there also has been increasing concern with secondhand smoke. This is especially true in closed environments and submarines may be deployed for months at a time. The current case study describes the successful implementation by the Navy of a comprehensive ban on smoking aboard submarines. METHODS: The authors searched documents on the internet, popular media, military-based news outlets and the scientific literature. We also conducted interviews with Navy officers who were instrumental in policy implementation. FINDINGS: Data demonstrating substantial exposure of non-smokers to tobacco smoke aboard submarines had major impact on successful adoption of the policy. A systematic and extended roll out of the ban included establishing a working group, soliciting input and active engagement from submarine personnel, and offering cessation assistance. Support was enlisted from Chief Petty Officers who could have been strongly opposed but who became strong proponents. Fewer problems were encountered than had been expected. In contrast to a previous unsuccessful attempt by a Navy captain to ban smoking on his ship, the ban was adopted without apparent tobacco industry interference. CONCLUSIONS: Lessons learned included the importance of strong empirical support, effective framing of the issue, setting a realistic timeline, soliciting support from key personnel and providing appropriate resources. These lessons have implications for those considering further tobacco policy changes in the military and elsewhere.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=25163466,0,0,0,0

METHODS: Data from a telephone survey conducted in 2001 in a random sample of Medicare consumers residing in North and South Carolina were used to examine barriers to CRC screening, focusing on consumers' reports of receiving a physician's recommendation to obtain CRC screening and reasons for not being screened. Analyses were restricted to respondents with no history of CRC (n = 1901). Descriptive statistics were used to characterize respondents' CRC screening status, receipt of a physician's recommendation for screening, and reasons for not being screened. Logistic regression modeling was used to examine factors associated with receiving a physician recommendation for fecal occult blood test, sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, any endoscopy, and any CRC test. RESULTS: Thirty-one percent of Medicare consumers had never been tested for CRC, and 18% had been tested but were not current with Medicare-covered intervals. Overall, 28% reported not receiving a physician recommendation for screening. Predictors of receiving a physician recommendation included sociodemographic (younger age, white race, more education), health status (increased CRC risk, comorbidity), and healthcare access (had a routine/preventive care visit in the past 12 months) factors. Lack of knowledge/awareness and the physician not ordering the test were commonly cited reasons for not having CRC tests.

OBJECTIVES: We sought to compare barriers to CRC screening reported by primary care physicians (PCPs) and by average-risk adults, and to examine characteristics of average-risk adults who identified lack of provider recommendation as a major barrier to CRC screening. RESEARCH DESIGN: This was a comparative study using data from the 1999-2000 Survey of Colorectal Cancer Screening Practices and the 2000 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). SUBJECTS: We recruited nationally representative samples of PCPs (n= 1235) from the SCCSP and average-risk adults (n = 6497) from the NHIS. MEASURES: We measured barriers to CRC screening identified by PCPs and average-risk adults who were not current with screening. RESULTS: Both PCPs and average-risk adults identified lack of patient awareness and physician recommendation as key barriers to obtaining CRC screening. PCPs also frequently cited patient embarrassment/anxiety about testing and test cost/lack of insurance coverage, but few adults identified these as major barriers. Of adults not current with testing, those who had visited a doctor in the past year or had health insurance were more likely to report lack of physician recommendation as the main reason they were not up-to-date compared with their counterparts with no doctor visit or health insurance. Only 10% of adults not current with testing and who had a doctor visit in the past year reported receiving a screening recommendation.

STUDY DESIGN: This study was a quantitative cross-sectional survey of English-speaking, AAW, 18-70 years old who were recruited from a community fair in Chicago, IL. Surveys were distributed to a convenience sample to assess knowledge of HPV, cervical cancer, and the HPV vaccine. Cumulative knowledge scores were calculated for each participant, and analysis was performed to identify factors that were associated with adequate knowledge scores. RESULTS: Three hundred twenty-two surveys were distributed; 242 surveys were collected, and 215 surveys met inclusion criteria. Mean knowledge score was 12.3 +/- 4.2 (mean +/- SD) of a maximum score of 28 (range, 3-23); 73% of participants scored <65% on the knowledge portion of the survey.

Logistic regressions were undertaken of baseline depressive symptoms (six-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D)) with (1) completion of 1- and 4-year study assessments and (2) validated change in dietary behavior in the intervention group. RESULTS: In the comparison group (vs. intervention), depressive symptoms lowered completion of dietary recalls and clinic visits [4 years: odds ratio (OR) = 2.0; 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1.4-3.0]. The behaviorally oriented intervention achieved major change in those furthest from study targets, although changes were lower in those with depressive symptoms: fruit/vegetable (+37.2 %), fiber (+49.0 %), and fat (-22.4 %).

Because sensory information forms the building blocks for higher-order social and cognitive functions, we argue that sensory processing is not only an additional piece of the puzzle, but rather a critical cornerstone for characterizing and understanding ASD. In this review we discuss what is currently known about sensory processing in ASD, how sensory function fits within contemporary models of ASD, and what is understood about the differences in the underlying neural processing of sensory and social communication observed between individuals with and without ASD. In addition to highlighting the sensory features associated with ASD, we also emphasize the importance of multisensory processing in building perceptual and cognitive representations, and how deficits in multisensory integration may also be a core characteristic of ASD.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26455789,0,0,1,0

Benefits and costs of interventions to improve breast cancer outcomes in African American women. J Clin Oncol 2004;22(13):2554-2566",2004,Benefits and costs of interventions to improve breast cancer outcomes in African American women,"PURPOSE: Historically, African American women have experienced higher breast cancer mortality than white women, despite lower incidence. Our objective was to evaluate whether costs of increasing rates of screening or application of intensive treatment will be off-set by survival benefits for African American women. METHODS: We use a stochastic simulation model of the natural history of breast cancer to evaluate the incremental societal costs and benefits of status quo versus targeted biennial screening or treatment improvements among African Americans 40 years of age and older. Main outcome measures were number of mammograms, stage, all-cause mortality, and discounted costs per life year saved (LYS). RESULTS: At the current screening rate of 76%, there is little incremental benefit associated with further increasing screening, and the costs are high: 124,053 US dollars and 124,217 US dollars per LYS for lay health worker and patient reminder interventions, respectively, compared with the status quo. Using reminders would cost 51,537 US dollars per LYS if targeted to virtually unscreened women or 78,130 US dollars per LYS if targeted to women with a two-fold increase in baseline risk. If all patients received the most intensive treatment recommended, costs increase but deaths decrease, for a cost of 52,678 US dollars per LYS. Investments of up to 6,000 US dollars per breast cancer patient could be used to enhance treatment and still yield cost-effectiveness ratios of less than 75,000 US dollars per LYS. CONCLUSION: Except in pockets of unscreened or high-risk women, further investments in interventions to increase screening are unlikely to be an efficient use of resources. Ensuring that African American women receive intensive treatment seems to be the most cost-effective approach to decreasing the disproportionate mortality experienced by this population","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Breast,"Health Services and Economics Branch, Applied Research Program",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=15173213,0,0,0,0

Women with both risk factors may be at very high risk. METHODS: We included 42818 women participating in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium who had no prior diagnosis of breast cancer and had undergone at least one benign breast biopsy and mammogram; 1359 women developed incident breast cancer in 6.1 years of follow-up (78.1% invasive, 21.9% ductal carcinoma in situ). We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) using Cox regression analysis. The referent group was women with nonproliferative changes and average density. All P values are two-sided. RESULTS: Benign breast disease and breast density were independently associated with breast cancer. The combination of atypical hyperplasia and very high density was uncommon (0.6% of biopsies) but was associated with the highest risk for breast cancer (HR = 5.34; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.52 to 8.09, P < .001). Proliferative disease without atypia (25.6% of biopsies) was associated with elevated risk that varied little across levels of density: average (HR = 1.37; 95% CI = 1.11 to 1.69, P = .003), high (HR = 2.02; 95% CI = 1.68 to 2.44, P < .001), or very high (HR = 2.05; 95% CI = 1.54 to 2.72, P < .001). Low breast density (4.5% of biopsies) was associated with low risk (HRs <1) for all benign pathology diagnoses.

We examine self-report bias in mammography screening rates overall, by age, and by race/ethnicity. METHODS: We use mammography registry data (1999-2000) from the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium to estimate the validity of self-reported mammography screening collected by two national surveys. First, we compare mammography use from 1999 to 2000 for a geographically defined population (Vermont) with self-reported rates in the prior two years from the 2000 Vermont Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. We then use a screening dissemination simulation model to assess estimates of mammography screening from the 2000 National Health Interview Survey. RESULTS: Self-report estimates of mammography use in the prior 2 years from the Vermont Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System are 15 to 25 percentage points higher than actual screening rates across age groups. The differences in National Health Interview Survey screening estimates from models are similar for women 40 to 49 and 50 to 59 years and greater than for those 60 to 69, or 70 to 79 (27 and 26 percentage points versus 14, and 14, respectively). Overreporting is highest among African American women (24.4 percentage points) and lowest among Hispanic women (17.9) with non-Hispanic White women in between (19.3). Values of sensitivity and specificity consistent with our results are similar to previous validation studies of mammography.

However, certain questions remain, including the ideal interval between mammograms. METHODS: We conducted an observational study using information collected by seven mammography registries across the United States to investigate whether women diagnosed with breast cancer after having screening mammograms separated by a 2-year interval (n = 2440) are more likely to be diagnosed with late-stage disease (positive lymph nodes or metastases) than women diagnosed with breast cancer after having screening mammograms separated by a 1-year interval (n = 5400). Analyses were stratified by age and breast density to clarify whether groups that have the poorest mammography sensitivity (i.e., women under age 50 years and those with mammographically dense breasts) would benefit most from annual screening. The subjects were women diagnosed with breast cancer between 1996 and 2001 who were 40-89 years old at their index mammographic examination (i.e., the most recent screen at or before breast cancer diagnosis). Data were analyzed by logistic regression, adjusting for race, ethnicity, family history of breast cancer, and mammography registry. RESULTS: Among women age 40-49 years at the index mammogram, those with a 2-year screening interval were more likely to have late-stage disease at diagnosis than those with a 1-year screening interval (28% versus 21%; odds ratio [OR] = 1.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01 to 1.81). There was no increase in late-stage disease for women 50 years or older with a 2-year versus a 1-year screening interval (women age 50-59 years at index mammogram: OR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.75 to 1.25; women age 60-69 years at index mammogram: OR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.72 to 1.35; women age 70 years or older at index mammogram: OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.64 to 1.19). There was no indication that women with dense breasts would benefit more from a 1-year versus 2-year screening interval than women with fatty breasts.

Antioxidant enzymes, such as Manganese Superoxide Dismutase (MnSOD or SOD2) and Glutathione Peroxidase-1 (GPx1), act coordinately to neutralize ROS. These enzymes are also thought to contribute to cancer cell resistance to conventional radio-chemo-therapies. Although some relationships have been reported between psychosocial factors and the regulation of antioxidant enzymes, little is known about these relationships in the context of cancer progression. The current study investigated the levels of MnSOD and GPx1in confirmed serous, high-grade tumor tissue from 60 ovarian cancer patients, and explored the relationship between the activity of these enzymes, the levels of tumor norepinephrine (NE), and patient mood as determined via pre-operative questionnaires. MnSOD activity was positively related to depressed mood (p=0.025) and tumor NE (p=0.023). In contrast, GPx1 activity was inversely related to fatigue (p=0.015) and tumor NE (p=0.009), and was positively associated with vigor (p=0.024).

No prior literature has examined if estrogen influences these differences. METHODS: Using data from an incident population-based case (n = 1,972) and control (n = 2386) study of colon cancer we evaluated if estrogen modifies the association between BMI and risk of colon cancer. RESULTS: Women who were estrogen-negative (postmenopausal women not taking hormone replacement therapy, HRT) were at increased risk of colon cancer regardless of indicator of estrogen status used (i.e. estrogen-negative compared to estrogen-positive women defined as either being premenopausal or postmenopausal women using HRT, OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.23-1.93; no recent exposure to estrogens compared to current or HRT use within the past 2 years, OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.24-2.00; postmenopausal women not currently using HRT compared to postmenopausal women taking HRT, OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.29-2.12). BMI (kg/m2) was not associated with an increased risk of colon cancer among women who were estrogen-negative. However, women who were estrogen-positive experienced a greater than two-fold increase in colon cancer risk if they had a BMI of > 30 relative to those who had a BMI of <23 (for estrogen-positive, OR, 2.50, 95% CI 1.51-4.13; premenopausal, OR 2.19, 95% CI 0.94-5.07; postmenopausal using HRT, OR 3.36, 95% CI 1.58-7.13). Among men the colon cancer risk associated with BMI decreased with advancing age. Physical activity modified the increased colon cancer risk associated with a large BMI. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest the importance of estrogen in colon cancer etiology. Being estrogen-negative resulted in a significant increased risk of colon cancer. However, BMI significantly increased the risk of colon cancer among women who were estrogen-positive. We hypothesize that estrogen up-regulates IGF-I receptors and IRS-I levels in the colon, which in turn increases susceptibility to obesity-induced increased levels of insulin.

This study investigated clinicians' perceptions of guidelines, reminders for screening, and plan and practice commitment in order to assess where opportunities exist to improve the screening process. METHODS: A stratified sample of 761 primary care clinicians from three comprehensive health plans were surveyed to assess awareness of and agreement with guideline elements, perception of guidelines' usefulness, awareness of plan strategies to promote guideline adherence, perception of support for high-quality screening services, and ratings of plan efforts to maximize members' access. RESULTS: Clinician awareness of and agreement with guideline elements was high (98% breast, 94% cervical). Across guideline elements, agreement was lower for mammography than cervical screening, notably for upper age limit recommendations (58% breast, 79% cervical). Knowledge of systems that cue patients and clinicians that screening is due varied by cancer test, and clinician report and plan report data about the existence of systems were, at times, not congruent. Views about consistent operation of systems differed by test (mammograms, 74%-92%; Pap, 66%-84%). Clinicians rated local colleagues and local and plan medical leadership as very committed to high-quality screening, albeit with somewhat lower ratings for cervical testing. Although the majority rated overall plan efforts to maximize screening as very good or excellent, perceived consistency of systems to cue a woman that she is due for testing and perception of collegial support were independently and significantly related to ratings of plan efforts. CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in knowledge of systems that support guideline implementation varied, and action to ensure accurate perception of reminders, as well as consistent implementation of systems, may be important for improving screening rates and outcomes.

RESULTS: PCPs reported greater barriers for CRC screening than for mammography. Lack of patient follow-through to complete recommended screening and the inability to pay for tests were the main barriers perceived by PCPs for both types of screening. Another major barrier cited was that patients do not perceive CRC as a threat. This was a lesser concern for the well-diffused message about the need for mammography.

Breast cancer risk assessment across the risk continuum: genetic and nongenetic risk factors contributing to differential model performance. Breast Cancer Res 2012;14(6)",2012,Breast cancer risk assessment across the risk continuum: genetic and nongenetic risk factors contributing to differential model performance,"INTRODUCTION: Clinicians use different breast cancer risk models for patients considered at average and above-average risk, based largely on their family histories and genetic factors. We used longitudinal cohort data from women whose breast cancer risks span the full spectrum to determine the genetic and nongenetic covariates that differentiate the performance of two commonly used models that include nongenetic factors - BCRAT, also called Gail model, generally used for patients with average risk and IBIS, also called Tyrer Cuzick model, generally used for patients with above-average risk. METHODS: We evaluated the performance of the BCRAT and IBIS models as currently applied in clinical settings for 10-year absolute risk of breast cancer, using prospective data from 1,857 women over a mean follow-up length of 8.1 years, of whom 83 developed cancer. This cohort spans the continuum of breast cancer risk, with some subjects at lower than average population risk. Therefore, the wide variation in individual risk makes it an interesting population to examine model performance across subgroups of women. For model calibration, we divided the cohort into quartiles of model-assigned risk and compared differences between assigned and observed risks using the Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) chi-squared statistic. For model discrimination, we computed the area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) and the case risk percentiles (CRPs). RESULTS: The 10-year risks assigned by BCRAT and IBIS differed (range of difference 0.001 to 79.5). The mean BCRAT- and IBIS-assigned risks of 3.18% and 5.49%, respectively, were lower than the cohort's 10-year cumulative probability of developing breast cancer (6.25%; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 5.0 to 7.8%). Agreement between assigned and observed risks was better for IBIS (HL X4(2) = 7.2, P value 0.13) than BCRAT (HL X4(2) = 22.0, P value <0.001). The IBIS model also showed better discrimination (AUC = 69.5%, CI = 63.8% to 75.2%) than did the BCRAT model (AUC = 63.2%, CI = 57.6% to 68.9%). In almost all covariate-specific subgroups, BCRAT mean risks were significantly lower than the observed risks, while IBIS risks showed generally good agreement with observed risks, even in the subgroups of women considered at average risk (for example, no family history of breast cancer, BRCA1/2 mutation negative). CONCLUSIONS: Models developed using extended family history and genetic data, such as the IBIS model, also perform well in women considered at average risk (for example, no family history of breast cancer, BRCA1/2 mutation negative). Extending such models to include additional nongenetic information may improve performance in women across the breast cancer risk continuum.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Breast,Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=23127309,0,0,0,0

Acculturation and fatalism are central cultural constructs in these growing fields of research. However, there is great debate on the extent to which acculturation and fatalism affect breast cancer screening among Latinas relative to other social or structural factors or logistical barriers. Moreover, little theoretical work specifies or tests pathways between social, structural, and cultural determinants of screening. This study tests a theoretical model of social and structural (socioeconomic status and access to health care) and cultural factors (acculturation and fatalism) as correlates of mammography screening among Dominican Latinas, a group that has been understudied. The study expands prior work by examining other factors identified as potential impediments to mammography screening, specifically psychosocial (e.g., embarrassment, pain) and logistical (e.g., not knowing how to get a mammogram, cost) barriers. Interview-administered surveys were conducted with 318 Latinas from the Dominican Republic aged 40 years or older. Fatalistic beliefs were not associated with mammogram screening. Greater acculturation assessed as language use was associated with decreased screening. The strongest predictor of decreased screening was perceived barriers. Results highlight the importance of assessing various self-reported psychosocial and logistical barriers to screening. Possible avenues for screening interventions include intensifying public health campaigns and use of personalized messages to address barriers to screening. Results add to a limited body of research on Dominicans, who constitute the fifth largest Latino group in the United States.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Breast,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=25869406,0,0,0,0

Cancer 2011;117(14):3101-3111",2011,"Breast cancer screening beliefs, recommendations and practices: Primary care physicians in the United States","BACKGROUND: Primary care physicians (PCPs) play a key role in breast cancer screening, yet no current data exist regarding PCP practices. METHODS: The authors analyzed a nationally representative survey of PCPs that was fielded during September 2006 to May 2007 to investigate PCP breast cancer screening beliefs, recommendations, and practices. RESULTS: Most of the 1212 PCPs who participated in the survey (80%) reported that mammography for average-risk women aged >/= 50 years was very effective in reducing cancer mortality, and 54% reported that it was very effective for women ages 40 to 49 years. Fewer respondents reported that clinical breast examination (CBE) or breast self-examination (BSE) was very effective, but the majority rated CBE and BSE as somewhat effective. The majority of PCPs routinely recommended mammography, CBE, and BSE to patients aged >/= 40 years. In multivariate models, family/general practitioners (odds ratio [OR], 2.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.57-3.17 for mammography; OR, 4.42; 95% CI, 2.60-7.52 for CBE) and internal medicine specialists (OR, 3.21; 95% CI, 2.21-4.66 for mammography; OR, 5.34; 95% CI, 3.21-8.88 for CBE) were more likely to recommend an upper age limit for screening than obstetrician/gynecologists. Physicians who reported that US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines were very influential were more likely to recommend an age at which they no longer recommend mammography and CBE. CONCLUSIONS: To the authors' knowledge, the current study is the first national study in over 2 decades to report the breast cancer screening practices of PCPs and provides baseline data for monitoring the impact of changes in clinical practice guidelines. The current findings suggested that virtually all PCPs routinely recommend mammography, CBE, and BSE to their patients aged >/= 40 years, although recommendations vary by primary care specialty.

Objective: To prospectively assess mammography screening by Asian-American women in a program with mailed recommendations and no out-of-pocket costs. Design: Two prospective cohort studies.Setting: A nonprofit health care system where women members = 40 years old are surveyed for breast cancer risk factors and enrolled into a screening program on survey completion. Participants: Program enrollment-All Asian-American women identified through a compilation of Asian surnames (Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, and Korean) and a random sample of 2000 women with non-Asian surnames, who were mailed a survey from May 1988 to April 1995. Mammogram participation-All Asian-American women and a random sample of 3000 women with non-Asian surnames, enrolled in the screening program and were mailed a first recommendation for screening from May 1988 to April 1994. Main Outcome Measures: Odds of program enrollment and mammogram use within one year (participation) by Asian-American women compared to non-Asian controls.Results: Compared to controls, Asian-American women were less likely to enroll in Breast Cancer Screening Program (BCSP) (odds ratio 0.53; 95% CI 0.43, 0.64). In aggregate, Asian-American women had similar mammogram participation rates. Among older Chinese-American women participation was lower compared to controls (odds ratio 0.66; 95% CI 0.44, 0.97).

For example, the incidence of breast cancer in South Carolina is lower in African American compared with European American women by approximately 12% to 15%, but their mortality rate is twice as high as in European American women. The purpose of the study was to assess factors associated with breast cancer mortality between African American and European American women. Participants (n=314) in South Carolina's Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (SCBCCEDP), which provides breast cancer screening and treatment services, during the years 1996-2004 were included in the study. Data, including tumor characteristics, delay intervals, and race, were examined using the chi(2) test and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Cox regression modeling was used to assess the relationship between delay intervals and other factors. No racial differences were found in age at diagnosis, tumor characteristics, or delay intervals. Time delay intervals did not explain differences and mortality rates by race. Survival, however, was affected by prognostic factors as well as by a significant interaction between hormone-receptor status and race. Despite the excellent record of the SCBCCEDP in screening and diagnostic or treatment referrals, the racial disparities in breast cancer mortality continue to exist in South Carolina.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 1996 to December 1999, Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System assessments and recommendations were collected prospectively for 1,171,792 screening examinations in 758,015 women aged 40-89 years at seven mammography registries in Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. Registries obtained waiver of signed consent or collected signed consent in accordance with institutional review boards at each location. Diagnosis of invasive cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ within 24 months of screening examination and tumor stage and size for invasive cancer were determined through linkage to pathology database or tumor registry. chi2 test was used to determine significant differences between groups. RESULTS: Overall, 5.2% of first and 1.7% of subsequent screens included recommendation for short-interval follow-up, which was similar to likelihood of recommendation for diagnostic evaluation (first screens, 4.6%; subsequent, 2.6%). Most recommendations for short-interval follow-up were based on screening mammography alone (86.2% of first screens, 77.5% of subsequent). Yield of cancer for screening examinations with probably benign finding (PBF) and recommendation for short-interval follow-up based on screening mammography alone tended to be lower than in those with PBF and recommendation for short-interval follow-up after additional work-up (first screens: 0.54% vs 0.96%, P=.10; subsequent: 1.50% vs 1.73%, P=.26). Proportion of stage II and higher disease tended to be higher for examinations with PBF and recommendation for short-interval follow-up based on screening mammography alone compared with those recommended for short-interval follow-up after additional work-up (first screens: 34.7% vs 24.4%, P=.43; subsequent: 27.5% vs 19.2%, P=.13). CONCLUSION: Many first screening examinations include recommendation for short-interval follow-up based on screening mammography alone.

We incorporated benign breast disease (BBD) diagnoses into the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) risk model, the only breast cancer risk assessment tool that uses breast density. METHODS: We developed and validated a competing-risk model using 2000 to 2010 SEER data for breast cancer incidence and 2010 vital statistics to adjust for the competing risk of death. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate the relative hazards for age, race/ethnicity, family history of breast cancer, history of breast biopsy, BBD diagnoses, and breast density in the BCSC. RESULTS: We included 1,135,977 women age 35 to 74 years undergoing mammography with no history of breast cancer; 17% of the women had a prior breast biopsy. During a mean follow-up of 6.9 years, 17,908 women were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. The BCSC BBD model slightly overpredicted risk (expected-to-observed ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.06) and had modest discriminatory accuracy (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve, 0.665). Among women with proliferative findings, adding BBD to the model increased the proportion of women with an estimated 5-year risk of 3% or higher from 9.3% to 27.8% (P<.001). CONCLUSION: The BCSC BBD model accurately estimates women's risk for breast cancer using breast density and BBD diagnoses.

Cancers diagnosed after a negative mammogram are known as interval cancers. This study investigated whether mammographic breast density is related to the risk of interval cancer. METHODS: Subjects were selected from women participating in mammographic screening from 1988 through 1993 in a large health maintenance organization based in Seattle, WA. Women were eligible for the study if they had been diagnosed with a first primary invasive breast cancer within 24 months of a screening mammogram and before a subsequent one. Interval cancer case subjects (n = 149) were women whose breast cancer occurred after a negative or benign mammographic assessment. Screen-detected control subjects (n = 388) were diagnosed after a positive screening mammogram. One radiologist, who was blinded to cancer status, assessed breast density by use of the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System. RESULTS: Mammographic sensitivity (i.e., the ability of mammography to detect a cancer) was 80% among women with predominantly fatty breasts but just 30% in women with extremely dense breasts. The odds ratio (OR) for interval cancer among women with extremely dense breasts was 6.14 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.95-19.4), compared with women with extremely fatty breasts, after adjustment for age at index mammogram, menopausal status, use of hormone replacement therapy, and body mass index. When only those interval cancer cases confirmed by retrospective review of index mammograms were considered, the OR increased to 9.47 (95% CI = 2.78-32.3).

This study attempted to characterize fully the tumors detected in the two different manners. METHODS: Our study utilized a case-control design and involved a cohort of women undergoing mammographic screening within the defined population of a health maintenance organization (the Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound). Women were classified as having 'interval' or 'interval-detected' cancers (n = 150) if their diagnosis was made within 24 months after a negative-screening mammogram or one that indicated a benign condition. Cancers were classified as 'screen detected' (n = 279) if the diagnosis occurred after a positive assessment by screening mammography. Tumors from women in each group were evaluated for clinical presentation, histology, proliferative characteristics, and expression of hormone receptors, p53 tumor suppressor protein, and c-erbB-2 protein. RESULTS: Interval-detected cancers occurred more in younger women and were of larger tumor size than screen-detected cancers.

A total of 15,440 women ages 40 to 85 years with breast cancer diagnosed within 1 year of an annual or within 2 years of a biennial screening mammogram. EXPOSURES: We updated previous analyses by using narrower intervals for defining annual (11-14 months) and biennial (23-26 months) screening. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We defined less favorable prognostic characteristics as tumors that were stage IIB or higher, size greater than 15 mm, positive nodes, and any 1 or more of these characteristics. We used log-binomial regression to model the proportion of breast cancers with less favorable characteristics following a biennial vs annual screen by 10-year age groups and by menopausal status and current postmenopausal HT use. RESULTS: Among 15,440 women with breast cancer, most were 50 years or older (13,182 [85.4%]), white (12,063 [78.1%]), and postmenopausal (9823 [63.6%]).

The CRN includes integral and affiliated research projects supported by a Scientific and Data Resources Core. Three characteristics of the CRN intensified the general challenges of consortium research: 1) its members are large health systems with legitimate concerns about confidentiality of data about enrollees, providers, and the organization; 2) CRN research projects often generate highly sensitive data about quality of care; and therefore 3) each participating organization wants a strong voice in CRN direction. CRN experience to date confirms that a consortium of health systems with internal research capacity can address a range of important cancer research questions that would be difficult to study in other venues.

The association was more apparent in women (>/=393 mg/day vs. <60 mg/day: HR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.58, 0.85; Ptrend = 0.001) than in men (HR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.75, 1.2; Ptrend = 0.81), and more apparent for melanomas occurring on body sites with higher continuous sun exposure (head, neck, and extremities; >/=393 mg/day vs. <60 mg/day: HR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.59, 0.86; Ptrend = 0.001) than for melanomas occurring on body sites with lower continuous sun exposure (trunk including shoulder, back, hip, abdomen, and chest; HR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.70, 1.2; Ptrend = 0.60). This pattern of association was similar to that for caffeinated coffee consumption, whereas no association was found for decaffeinated coffee consumption and melanoma risk. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing caffeine intake and caffeinated coffee consumption is associated with decreased risk of cutaneous malignant melanomas.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Melanoma, Skin",Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26172864,0,1,0,0

The calibrated YAP was designed to estimate minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary behavior (SB). METHODS: The YAP was calibrated/validated in adolescents (aged 12-17 years) using cross-sectional data from the FLASHE study. Participants wore a GT3X+ ActiGraph on the dominant wrist for 7 days and then completed the YAP. Calibration was conducted for school (n=118); out of school (n=119); weekend (n=61); and SB (n=116) subsections of the YAP and by regressing percentage time in MVPA/SB (%MVPA/%SB) on each respective YAP subsection score, age, and the interaction between these two. The final algorithms were applied to independent samples (n=39-51) to examine validity (median absolute percentage error, equivalence testing). RESULTS: The final algorithms explained 15% (school); 16% (out of school); and 12% (weekend) of the variability in GT3X+ %MVPA and 7% of the variability in GT3X+ %SB. The calibrated algorithms were applied to independent samples and predicted GT3X+ minutes of MVPA/SB, with median absolute percentage error values ranging from 12.5% (SB section) to 32.5% (weekend section). Predicted values obtained from the YAP were within 10%-20% of those produced by the GT3X+. CONCLUSIONS: The YAP-predicted minutes of MVPA/SB resulted in similar group estimates obtained from an objective measure. The YAP offers good utility for large-scale research projects to characterize PA/SB levels among groups of youth.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=28526365,0,0,0,0

DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort study. SETTING: Not applicable. PATIENT(S): New York, Texas, and Illinois residents between 2004 and 2009, treated with ART, comprising cycles of 113,226 women, including 53,859 women without prior ART treatment, who were linked to their respective state cancer registries and whose cycles were reported to the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology Clinic Outcomes Reporting System (SART CORS). INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Diagnosis of cancer, as reported to the state cancer registry; standardized incidence ratios (SIR) and their 95% confidence intervals, comparing the observed to expected cancer cases based on age-specific cancer rates in the general population of each state. RESULT(S): Among the cohort of women without prior ART therapy, hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for treatment parameters and reproductive history factors. The mean follow-up period was 4.87 years; among women without prior ART, 450 women developed 460 cancers. Women treated with ART had a statistically significantly lower risk for all cancers (for all women: SIR 0.78; CI, 0.73-0.83; women without prior ART: SIR 0.75; CI, 0.68-0.82), breast cancer, and all female genital cancers; a non-statistically-significant lower risk for endocrine and uterine cancer; and a non-statistically-significant higher risk for melanoma and ovarian cancer. Among women without prior ART, we found no statistically significant increased HR by parity, number of cycles, cumulative follicle-stimulating hormone dosage, or cycle outcome. CONCLUSION(S): Women initiating ART treatment have no greater risk for developing cancer after nearly 5 years of follow-up compared with the general population and with other women treated with ART.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Melanoma, Breast, Female Genital Organs, Skin, Urinary Tract",Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26271227,0,0,0,0

Younger and better educated patients have more active roles in decisions, but whether patients' roles in decisions differ by characteristics of the decision itself is unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We surveyed a large, population-based cohort of patients with recently diagnosed lung or colorectal cancer about their roles in decisions regarding surgery, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy. We used multinomial logistic regression to assess whether characteristics of the decision, including evidence about the treatment's benefit, whether the decision was likely preference-sensitive (palliative therapy for metastatic cancer), and treatment modality, influenced patients' roles in that decision. RESULTS: Of 10,939 decisions made by 5,383 patients, 38.9% were patient controlled, 43.6% were shared, and 17.5% were physician controlled. When there was good evidence to support a treatment, shared control was greatest; when evidence was uncertain, patient control was greatest; and when there was no evidence for or evidence against a treatment, physician control was greatest (overall P < .001). Decisions about treatments for metastatic cancers tended to be more physician controlled than other decisions (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Patients making decisions about treatments for which no evidence supports benefit and decisions about noncurative treatments reported more physician control, which suggests that patients may not want the responsibility of deciding on treatments that will not cure them. Better strategies for shared decision making may be needed when there is no evidence to support benefit of a treatment or when patients have terminal illnesses that cannot be cured","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,"Outcomes Research, Health Services and Economics Branch, Applied Research Program",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=20713872,0,0,0,0

METHODS: From a 2006-2007 nationally representative survey, we identified 1,111 practicing primary care physicians who provide breast and cervical cancer screenings and assessed their recommendations using clinical vignettes related to screening initiation, frequency, and cessation. Responses of physicians participating in the NBCCEDP were compared with those from nonparticipating physicians. RESULTS: Of the physicians surveyed, 15% reported participation in the NBCCEDP, 65% were not participants, and 20% were not sure or did not respond to this question. Program physicians were significantly more likely to practice in multispecialty settings, in a rural location, and in a hospital or clinic setting and had more patients who were female and insured by Medicaid or uninsured compared with nonprogram physicians.

Multivariable logistic regression assessed the relationship between treatment summary receipt and PCC. The prevalence of survivors' treatment summary receipt and demographic/clinical characteristics predictive of treatment summary receipt were also assessed. RESULTS: Of 359 respondents with a cancer history, 34.5% reported receiving a treatment summary. Greater treatment burden was associated with increased treatment summary receipt. Treatment summary receipt was associated with higher QOC and more PCC, both overall and for five of the six PCC functions. CONCLUSION: The receipt of cancer treatment summaries may improve PCC and QOC for survivors.

Physiol Behav 2015;150:93-98",2015,Cardiovascular responses to an acute psychological stressor are associated with the cortisol awakening response in individuals with chronic neck pain,"INTRODUCTION: Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-axis) is common in individuals who experience chronic psychological stress, as well as individuals with chronic pain. Changes in cortisol availability in the presence of a chronic stressor such as pain may influence the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary (SAM) system, which contributes to cardiovascular responses to stress and also exhibits altered responsiveness in the presence of pain. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between HPA activity during the cortisol awakening response and cardiovascular reactivity during exposure to an acute psychological stressor in individuals with chronic neck pain. METHODS: Area under the curve (AUC) of the salivary cortisol awakening response was assessed in 41 individuals with chronic neck pain aged 19-80 years (22 men, 23 women). Slopes representing the change in mean arterial pressure and heart rate during a baseline quiet sitting condition, a low stress condition with mental concentration, and a high stress condition combining mental concentration with social evaluative threat were calculated for each individual as an index of cardiovascular responsiveness to the acute stressor. Cardiovascular responses were regressed on cortisol awakening AUC and pain duration, adjusting for age and sex. RESULTS: Greater mean arterial pressure (beta = -0.33, p = 0.02) and heart rate responses (beta = -0.41, p = 0.007) to the acute psychological stressor were associated with lower cortisol awakening responses after adjusting for age and sex. Individuals with a shorter duration of chronic pain also demonstrated a larger increase in mean arterial pressure during the laboratory stressor (beta = -0.39, p = 0.01), but there was no relationship between pain duration and changes in heart rate (p = 0.25). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with a shorter duration of chronic neck pain who demonstrate heightened cardiovascular responsiveness to an acute psychological stressor also exhibit lower cortisol awakening response. These results are consistent with time-dependent adaptations across the two major stress systems in the presence of chronic pain.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=25662023,0,1,0,1

We assess the prevalence of CVD risk factors among long-term cancer survivors and compare results to survey data from the general population in the same geographic region. We also characterize how often at-risk survivors discuss CVD-related health behaviors with their health care providers. METHODS: Survivors (n = 1,582) of breast, prostate, colorectal, and gynecologic cancers, 4-14 years after diagnosis, were recruited from two California cancer registries for a cross-sectional mail survey. We assessed CVD risk factors, including smoking, body mass index, physical inactivity, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and diabetes, as well as report of discussions with health care providers about diet, exercise, smoking, and lifestyle change assistance. RESULTS: With the exception of current smoking, CVD risk factors were more common among survivors than the general adult population. Of survivors, 62.0 % were overweight or obese, 55.0 % reported hypertension, 20.7 % reported diabetes, 18.1 % were inactive, and 5.1 % were current smokers. Compared to white, non-Hispanic survivors, Hispanic (b = 0.37, p = 0.007) and African-American (b = 0.66, p < 0.0001), but not Asian, survivors reported significantly more risk factors. One in three survivors with one or more risk factors for CVD did not report a health promotion discussion with their health care providers. CONCLUSIONS: CVD risk factors are common among long-term survivors, but many at-risk survivors may not discuss lifestyle prevention with their health care team. Primary care and oncology should work together to deliver optimal survivorship care that addresses CVD risk factors, as well as prevalent disease.

Postdocs from all social backgrounds reported significant declines in interest in faculty careers at research-intensive universities and increased interest in nonresearch careers; however, there were differences in the magnitude and period of training during which these changes occurred across gender and race/ethnicity. Group differences in interest in faculty careers were explained by career interest differences formed during graduate school but not by differences in research productivity, research self-efficacy, or advisor relationships.

To reduce cervical cancer among such women, reasons for its occurrence must be better understood. We examined factors associated with the diagnosis of cervical cancer among women enrolled in health plans. METHODS: We identified all cases of invasive cervical cancer (n = 833) diagnosed from January 1, 1995, through December 31, 2000, among women who were long-term members of seven prepaid comprehensive health plans and reviewed each woman's medical records for the 3 years prior to her cancer diagnosis. Women were classified into one of three categories based on Pap test histories 4-36 months before diagnosis: failure to screen with a Pap test, failure in detection by a Pap test, or failure in follow-up of an abnormal test result. RESULTS: The majority of cases (n = 464; 56%) were in women who had no Pap tests during the period 4-36 months prior to diagnosis. Of the remaining cases, 263 (32%) were attributed to Pap test detection failure and 106 (13%) to follow-up failure. Being older (odds ratio [OR] = 6.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.89 to 10.79) or living in an area of higher poverty (OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.11 to 2.67) or having a lower education level (OR= 1.52; 95% CI = 1.07 to 2.16) was associated with the likelihood of being assigned to the failure to screen category versus either of the other two categories. A total of 375 (81%) of the 464 patients who had not had Pap screening had had at least one outpatient visit 4-36 months prior to cancer diagnosis. The cancer diagnostic process was triggered by a routine screening examination in 44% of patients, whereas 53% of the patients presented with symptoms consistent with cervical cancer; the remaining 3% were identified fortuitously during the course of receiving noncervical care.

Our objective was to develop a framework for examining health and economic tradeoffs between screening test sensitivity, population coverage and follow-up of screen-positive women, to help decision makers identify where program investments yield the greatest value. As an illustrative example, we used an individual-based Monte Carlo simulation model of the natural history of human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical cancer calibrated to epidemiologic data from Uganda. We assumed once in a lifetime screening at age 35 with two-visit HPV DNA testing or one-visit visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA). We assessed the health and economic tradeoffs that arise between (i) test sensitivity and screening coverage; (ii) test sensitivity and loss to follow-up (LTFU) of screen-positive women; and (iii) test sensitivity, screening coverage and LTFU simultaneously. The decline in health benefits associated with sacrificing HPV DNA test sensitivity by 20% (e.g., shifting from provider- to self-collection of specimens) could be offset by gains in coverage if coverage increased by at least 20%. When LTFU was 10%, two-visit HPV DNA testing with 80-90% sensitivity was more effective and more cost-effective than one-visit VIA with 40% sensitivity and yielded greater health benefits than VIA even as VIA sensitivity increased to 60% and HPV test sensitivity declined to 70%. As LTFU increased, two-visit HPV DNA testing became more costly and less effective than one-visit VIA. Setting-specific data on achievable test sensitivity, coverage, follow-up rates and programmatic costs are needed to guide decision making for cervical cancer screening.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Cervix, Female Genital Organs",Healthcare Delivery Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=25943074,0,1,0,0

The goal of the ASA24 development is to create a web-based dietary interview based on the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Automated Multiple Pass Method (AMPM) instrument currently used in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The ASA24 food list, detail probes, and portion probes were drawn from the AMPM instrument; portion-size pictures from Baylor College of Medicine's Food Intake Recording Software System (FIRSSt) were added; and the food code/portion code assignments were linked to the USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS). The requirements that the interview be self-administered and fully auto-coded presented several challenges as the AMPM probes and responses were linked with the FNDDS food codes and portion pictures. This linking was accomplished through a 'food pathway,' or the sequence of steps that leads from a respondent's initial food selection, through the AMPM probes and portion pictures, to the point at which a food code and gram weight portion size are assigned. The ASA24 interview database that accomplishes this contains more than 1,100 food probes and more than 2 million food pathways and will include about 10,000 pictures of individual foods depicting up to 8 portion sizes per food.

Short telomeres are associated with increased cancer risk, but there are conflicting reports about telomere length and mortality in breast cancer survivors. METHODS: We measured peripheral blood leukocyte telomere length at two time points in women enrolled in a multiethnic, prospective cohort of stage I to stage IIIA breast cancer survivors diagnosed between 1995 and 1999 with a median follow-up of 11.2 years. We evaluated associations between telomere length measured at mean 6 (baseline; LTL0; n = 611) and 30 months (LTL30; n = 478) after diagnosis and the change between those time points (n = 478), with breast cancer-specific and all-cause mortality using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for possible confounders. Statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: There were 135 deaths, of which 74 were due to breast cancer. Neither baseline nor 30-month telomere length was associated with either all-cause or breast cancer-specific mortality (LTL0: hazard ratio [HR] = 0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.67 to 1.02; HR = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.67 to 1.15; LTL30: HR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.59 to 1.05; HR = 0.86; 95% = CI = 0.58 to 1.26, respectively).

RESULTS: Women increased their weight and percent body fat by 1.7 +/- 4.7 kg and 2.1% +/- 3.9%, respectively, from during their first year of diagnosis to during their third year of diagnosis. A total of 68% and 74% of patients gained weight and body fat, respectively. Greater increases in weight were observed among women diagnosed with a higher disease stage, younger age, being postmenopausal, and women who decreased their physical activity from diagnosis to up to 3 years after diagnosis (P for trend < .05). CONCLUSION: Weight and body fat increased in the postdiagnosis period. Future research should focus on the effect of physical activity on weight and fat loss and breast cancer prognosis","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Breast,Applied Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=15681521,1,1,0,1

Differential coverage by lay newspapers may have contributed to the differential impact. OBJECTIVE: To examine newspaper coverage of HT before and after the publication of the Heart and Estrogen Replacement Study (HERS) in August 1998, and the main findings of the estrogen plus progestin therapy arm of the Women's Health Initiative (EPT-WHI) in July 2002. DESIGN: Longitudinal review of newspaper articles, 1998 to 2003 (n=663). SETTING: Twenty local and 6 regional/national newspapers. MEASUREMENTS: Number and content of articles about HT. RESULTS: The average number of articles about HT published during the month of the publication of the EPT-WHI was at least 8-fold greater than the number of articles published on the topic during any prior period. While the majority of articles in all periods presented information about the potential benefits of HT, information about harms became more common than information about benefits during the 2 months before the publication of the EPT-WHI, when the trial participants were notified of the early termination of the study. The presentation of specific health harms was more common after the publication of the EPT-WHI than after the publication of HERS. Few articles in any period used visual aids. CONCLUSIONS: The publication of the EPT-WHI was associated with a change in both the volume and content of newspaper coverage about HT.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Applied Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=16499542,1,1,0,0

Tob Control 2015;24",2015,"Changes in tar yields and cigarette design in samples of Chinese cigarettes, 2009 and 2012","BACKGROUND: China is home to the greatest number of smokers as well as the greatest number of smoking-related deaths. An active and growing market of cigarettes marketed as 'light' or 'low tar' may keep health-concerned smokers from quitting, wrongly believing that such brands are less harmful. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to observe changes in cigarette design characteristics and reported tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide (TNCO) levels in a sample of cigarette brands obtained in seven Chinese cities from 2009 to 2012. METHODS: Cigarettes were purchased and shipped to Roswell Park Cancer Institute, where 91 pairs of packs were selected for physical cigarette design characteristic testing and recording of TNCO values. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS, and was initially characterised using descriptive statistics, correlations and generalised estimating equations to observe changes in brand varieties over time. FINDINGS: Reported TNCO values on packs saw mean tar, nicotine and CO levels decrease from 2009 to 2012 by 7.9%, 4.5% and 6.0%, respectively. Ventilation was the only cigarette design feature that significantly changed over time (p<0.001), with an increase of 31.7%. Significant predictors of tar and CO yield overall were ventilation and per-cigarette tobacco weight, while for nicotine tobacco moisture was also an independent predictor of yield. CONCLUSIONS: The use of ventilation to decrease TNCO emissions is misleading smokers to believe that they are smoking a 'light/low' tar cigarette that is healthier, and is potentially forestalling the quitting behaviours that would begin to reduce the health burden of tobacco in China, and so should be prohibited.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=25352560,1,1,0,0

Clin Trials 2015;12(6):618-626",2015,Characteristics of clinical trials that require participants to be fluent in English,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Diverse samples in clinical trials can make findings more generalizable. We sought to characterize the prevalence of clinical trials in the United States that required English fluency for participants to enroll in the trial. METHODS: We randomly chose over 10,000 clinical trial protocols registered with ClinicalTrials.gov and examined the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the trials. We compared the relationship of clinical trial characteristics with English fluency inclusion requirements. We merged the ClinicalTrials.gov data with US Census and American Community Survey data to investigate the association of English-language restrictions with ZIP-code-level demographic characteristics of participating institutions. We used Chi-squared tests, t-tests, and logistic regression models for analyses. RESULTS: English fluency requirements have been increasing over time, from 1.7% of trials having such requirements before 2000 to 9.0% after 2010 (p < 0.001 from Chi-squared test). Industry-sponsored trials had low rates of English fluency requirements (1.8%), while behavioral trials had high rates (28.4%). Trials opening in the Northeast of the United States had the highest regional English requirement rates (10.7%), while trials opening in more than one region had the lowest (3.3%, p<0.001). Since 1995, trials opening in ZIP codes with larger Hispanic populations were less likely to have English fluency requirements (odds ratio=0.92 for each 10% increase in proportion of Hispanics, 95% confidence interval=0.86-0.98, p=0.013). Trials opening in ZIP codes with more residents self-identifying as Black/African American (odds ratio=1.87, 95% confidence interval=1.36-2.58, p<0.001 for restricted cubic spline term) or Asian (odds ratio=1.16 for linear term, 95% confidence interval=1.07-1.25, p<0.001) were more likely to have English fluency requirements. ZIP codes with higher poverty rates had trials with more English-language restrictions (odds ratio=1.06 for a 10% poverty rate increase, 95% confidence interval=1.001-1.11, p=0.045). There was a statistically significant interaction between year and intervention type, such that the increase in English fluency requirements was more common for some interventions than for others. CONCLUSION: The proportion of clinical trials registered with ClinicalTrials.gov that have English fluency requirements for study inclusion has been increasing over time. English-language restrictions are associated with a number of characteristics, including the demographic characteristics of communities in which the sponsoring institutions are located.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26152834,0,0,0,0

Addict Behav 2015;50:40-44",2015,Characteristics of emerging adulthood and e-cigarette use: findings from a pilot study,"INTRODUCTION: Emerging adults (ages 18 to 25) are more likely to use e-cigarettes compared to other age groups, but little is known about their risk and protective factors. A next step to understanding e-cigarette use among emerging adults may involve examining how transition-to-adulthood themes are associated with e-cigarette use. It may also be important to know which specific transitions, and how the accumulated number of role transitions experienced in emerging adulthood, are associated with e-cigarette use. METHODS: Emerging adults completed surveys indicating their identification with transition-to-adulthood themes, role transitions in the past year, and e-cigarette use. Logistic regression models examined the associations between transition-to-adulthood themes and e-cigarette use. Separate logistic regression models explored the association between individual role transitions, as well as the accumulated number of role transitions experienced, and e-cigarette use, controlling for age, gender, and ethnicity. RESULTS: Among the participants (n = 555), 21% were male, the average age was 22, 45% reported lifetime, and 12% reported past-month, e-cigarette use. Participants who felt emerging adulthood was a time of experimentation/possibility were more likely to report e-cigarette use. Several role transitions were found to be associated with e-cigarette use such as loss of a job, dating someone new, and experiencing a breakup. The relationship between the accumulated number of role transitions and e-cigarette use was curvilinear. CONCLUSION: Findings from this pilot study can be a point of departure for future studies looking to understand the risk and protective factors of e-cigarettes among emerging adults.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26093505,1,0,0,1

However, information on the mammography technologist workforce is scant. METHODS: In 2013, we conducted a survey mailed to 912 mammography technologists working in 224 facilities certified by the Mammography Quality Standards Act in North Carolina. Using standard survey methodology, we developed and implemented a questionnaire on the education and training, work experiences, and workplace interactions of mammography technologists. We aggregated responses using survey weights to account for nonresponse. We describe and compare lead (administrative responsibilities) and nonlead (supervised by another technologist) mammography technologist characteristics, testing for differences, using t-tests and chi(2) analysis. RESULTS: A total of 433 mammography technologists responded (survey response rate = 47.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 44.2%-50.7%), including 128 lead and 305 nonlead technologists. Most mammography technologists were non-Hispanic, white women; their average age was 48 years. Approximately 93% of lead and nonlead technologists had mammography-specific training, but <4% had sonography certification, and 3% had MRI certification. Lead technologists reported more years of experience performing screening mammography (P = .02) and film mammography (P = .03), more administrative hours (P < .0001), and more workplace autonomy (P = .002) than nonlead technologists. Nonlead technologists were more likely to report performing diagnostic mammograms (P = .0004) or other breast imaging (P = .001), discuss image quality with a peer (P = .013), and have frequent face-to-face interaction with radiologists (P = .03).

Dual users may have lower cigarette consumption levels, which may also play a role in smoking cessation. METHODS: The 2010-2011 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey included 26,760 current cigarette smokers, of which 675 concurrently used smokeless tobacco. We compared characteristics of the most recent cigarette smoking quit attempt of the past year between dual users and exclusive smokers, using multivariate regression. RESULTS: Dual users (45%) were more likely than exclusive smokers (37%) to have made a cigarette smoking quit attempt during the previous year (p<0.01), even after adjusting for demographic differences and cigarette dependence levels (ORadj 1.33, 95% CI 1.15-1.53). Half (48%) of dual users who made a quit attempt tried to quit ""by switching to smokeless tobacco"". However, once in a quit attempt, dual users relapsed more quickly than exclusive smokers (Cox regression HRadj 1.13, 95% CI 1.02-1.26). There was no difference in 30-day abstinence rates on the most recent quit attempt (ORadj 1.09, 95% CI 0.88-1.37). For both groups, the best predictor of past 30-day abstinence was cigarette consumption level. CONCLUSIONS: Current cigarette smokers who also use smokeless tobacco are more likely to have tried to quit, but relapse more quickly than exclusive smokers, and are not more likely to have attained 30day smoking cessation.

We used evidence of polymorphisms altering OPRM1 expression in normal human brain tissue to nominate and then test associations with heroin addiction. METHODS: We tested 103 OPRM1 SNPs for association with OPRM1 messenger RNA expression in prefrontal cortex from 224 European Americans and African Americans of the BrainCloud cohort. We then tested the 16 putative cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) SNPs for association with heroin addiction in the Urban Health Study and two replication cohorts, totaling 16,729 European Americans, African Americans, and Australians of European ancestry. RESULTS: Four putative cis-eQTL SNPs were significantly associated with heroin addiction in the Urban Health Study (smallest p = 8.9 x 10(-5)): rs9478495, rs3778150, rs9384169, and rs562859. Rs3778150, located in OPRM1 intron 1, was significantly replicated (p = 6.3 x 10(-5)). Meta-analysis across all case-control cohorts resulted in p = 4.3 x 10(-8): the rs3778150-C allele (frequency = 16%-19%) being associated with increased heroin addiction risk. Importantly, the functional SNP allele rs1799971-A was associated with heroin addiction only in the presence of rs3778150-C (p = 1.48 x 10(-6) for rs1799971-A/rs3778150-C and p = .79 for rs1799971-A/rs3778150-T haplotypes). Lastly, replication was observed for six other intron 1 SNPs that had prior suggestive associations with heroin addiction (smallest p = 2.7 x 10(-8) for rs3823010). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that common OPRM1 intron 1 SNPs have replicable associations with heroin addiction.

The authors examined the impact of beta-adrenergic blockade on the clinical outcome of women with epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancers (collectively, epithelial ovarian cancer [EOC]). METHODS: A multicenter review of 1425 women with histopathologically confirmed EOC was performed. Comparisons were made between patients with documented beta-blocker use during chemotherapy and those without beta-blocker use. RESULTS: The median age of patients in the current study was 63 years (range, 21-93 years). The sample included 269 patients who received beta-blockers. Of those, 193 (71.7%) were receiving beta-1-adrenergic receptor selective agents, and the remaining patients were receiving nonselective beta antagonists. The primary indication for beta-blocker use was hypertension but also included arrhythmia and postmyocardial infarction management. For patients receiving any beta-blocker, the median overall survival (OS) was 47.8 months versus 42 months for nonusers (P =.04).

Whether treatments that target insomnia-related complaints might reverse these markers of inflammation in older adults with insomnia is not known. METHODS: In this randomized trial, 123 older adults with insomnia were randomly assigned to cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), tai chi chih (TCC), or sleep seminar education active control condition for 2-hour sessions weekly over 4 months with follow-up at 7 and 16 months. We measured C-reactive protein (CRP) at baseline and months 4 and 16; toll-like receptor-4 activated monocyte production of proinflammatory cytokines at baseline and months 2, 4, 7, and 16; and genome-wide transcriptional profiling at baseline and month 4. RESULTS: As compared with sleep seminar education active control condition, CBT-I reduced levels of CRP (months 4 and 16, ps < .05), monocyte production of proinflammatory cytokines (month 2 only, p < .05), and proinflammatory gene expression (month 4, p < .01).

METHODS: A systematic literature search (1995-2008) was conducted to identify studies that reported barriers to or facilitators of CRC screening uptake, compliance or adherence specifically for older persons (> or = 65 years). Information on study characteristics and barriers and facilitators related to subjects; healthcare providers; policies; and screening tests were then abstracted and analyzed. RESULTS: Eighty-three studies met the eligibility criteria. Low level of education, African American race, Hispanic ethnicity, and female gender were the most frequently reported barriers, whereas being married or living with a partner was the most frequently reported facilitator. The most cited barrier related to healthcare providers was lack of screening recommendation by a physician; having a usual source of care was a commonly reported facilitator. Lack of health insurance, and dual coverage with Medicare and Medicaid were the most frequently reported barriers, whereas Medicare's coverage of screening colonoscopy was consistently reported as a facilitator. CONCLUSIONS: Barriers to, and facilitators of, CRC screening among older persons are reported.

METHODS: Data from 1266 physicians responding to the 2006-2007 National Survey of Primary Care Physicians' Recommendations and Practices for Breast, Cervical, Colorectal, and Lung Cancer Screening (cooperation rate=75%) were analyzed in 2008. Descriptive statistics were used to examine physicians' CRC screening recommendations and practices as well as the office systems used to support screening activities. Sample weights were applied in the analyses to obtain national estimates. RESULTS: Ninety-five percent of physicians routinely recommend screening colonoscopy to asymptomatic, average-risk patients; 80% recommend fecal occult blood testing (FOBT). Only a minority recommend sigmoidoscopy, double-contrast barium enema, computed tomographic colonography, or fecal DNA testing. Fifty-six percent recommend two screening modalities; 17% recommend one. Nearly all physicians who recommend endoscopy refer their patients for the procedure. Four percent perform sigmoidoscopy, a 25-percentage-point decline from 1999-2000. Although 61% of physicians reported that their practice had guidelines for CRC screening, only 30% use provider reminders; 15% use patient reminders. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians' CRC screening recommendations and practices have changed substantially since 1999-2000. Colonoscopy is now the most frequently recommended test. Most physicians do not recommend the full menu of test options prescribed in national guidelines. Few perform sigmoidoscopy. Office systems to support CRC screening are lacking in many physicians' practices.

J Oncol Pract 2014;10(4)",2014,Colorectal cancer survivors' needs and preferences for survivorship information,"PURPOSE: Before developing a survivorship care plan (SCP) that colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors will value, understanding the informational needs of CRC survivors is critical. METHODS: We surveyed survivors treated for nonmetastatic CRC at two hospitals in New York about their needs and preferences for survivorship information. Participants completed treatment 6 to 24 months before the interview and had not received an SCP. We evaluated whether survivors knew their treatment history (10 topics), whether they understood ongoing risks (four topics), and their preferences for receiving 16 topics of survivorship information. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-five survivors completed the survey. Most survivors remembered information about past treatment (98% to 99% for each treatment). Fewer survivors knew their risks of local recurrence, distant recurrence, or developing a new CRC (69%, 77%, and 40%, respectively). Most participants reported receiving information about their cancer history and ongoing oncology visits (77% to 86% across topics). Across all topics, 93% to 99% of those who reported receiving information found the information useful. A minority of survivors reported they received information about symptoms to report to doctors, returning to work, or financial or legal issues (5% to 48% across topics), but those who did found the information useful (89% to 100% across topics). CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of an SCP, CRC survivors still generally understood their cancer history. However, many lacked knowledge of ongoing risks and prevention. Most survivors stated that they found the survivorship information they received useful. SCPs for CRC survivors should focus less on past care and more on helping survivors understand their risks and plan for the future.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Colorectal, Digestive Organs",Office of Cancer Survivorship,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=24893610,0,1,0,1

METHODS: We used a cross-sectional nationally representative survey of 950 primary care physicians familiar with human papillomavirus (HPV) testing to assess adherence to management guidelines by analyzing responses to two clinical vignettes of a 35-year-old woman who had Pap and HPV tests results: 1) discordant (normal Pap and positive HPV) or 2) mildly abnormal (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance Pap and negative HPV). Analyses included multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: For the discordant test results, 54.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 51-57.6%) of physicians recommended both Pap and HPV testing in 6-12 months, adhering to management guidelines. For the mildly abnormal results, only 12.2% (95% CI 10-14.7%) had a guideline-adherent recommendation of Pap testing in 12 months with no HPV test. In multivariable analyses, no significant difference among physicians' specialties was observed for the discordant results. For the mildly abnormal results, physician specialty was associated with guideline adherence in which obstetrician-gynecologists had the highest percent of adherence (19.8%) compared with family and general practitioners (9.3%) and internists (11%) (P<.001).

Common model inputs used in CISNET collaborative breast cancer modeling. Med Decis Making 2018;38(1_suppl):9S-23S",2018,Common model inputs used in CISNET collaborative breast cancer modeling,"BACKGROUND: Since their inception in 2000, the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Network (CISNET) breast cancer models have collaborated to use a nationally representative core of common input parameters to represent key components of breast cancer control in each model. Employment of common inputs permits greater ability to compare model output than when each model begins with different input parameters. The use of common inputs also enhances inferences about the results, and provides a range of reasonable results based on variations in model structure, assumptions, and methods of use of the input values. The common input data are updated for each analysis to ensure that they reflect the most current practice and knowledge about breast cancer. The common core of parameters includes population rates of births and deaths; age- and cohort-specific temporal rates of breast cancer incidence in the absence of screening and treatment; effects of risk factors on incidence trends; dissemination of plain film and digital mammography; screening test performance characteristics; stage or size distribution of screen-, interval-, and clinically- detected tumors by age; the joint distribution of ER/HER2 by age and stage; survival in the absence of screening and treatment by stage and molecular subtype; age-, stage-, and molecular subtype-specific therapy; dissemination and effectiveness of therapies over time; and competing non-breast cancer mortality. METHOD AND RESULTS: In this paper, we summarize the methods and results for the common input values presently used in the CISNET breast cancer models, note assumptions made because of unobservable phenomena and/or unavailable data, and highlight plans for the development of future parameters.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A survey was developed and applied to community-based facilities providing screening mammography in three geographically distinct locations in the states of Washington, Colorado, and New Hampshire. The facility survey was conducted between December 2001 and September 2002. Characteristics surveyed included facility type, services offered, charges for screening and diagnostic mammography, information systems, and interpretation methods, including the frequency of double interpretation. RESULTS: Among 45 responding facilities, services offered included screening mammography at all facilities, diagnostic mammography at 34 facilities (76%), breast sonography at 30 (67%), breast MRI at seven (16%), and nuclear medicine breast scanning at seven (16%). Most facilities surveyed were radiology practices in nonhospital settings. Eight facilities (18%) reported performing clinical breast examinations routinely along with screening mammography. Only five screening sites (11%) used computer-aided detection (CAD) and only two (5%) used digital mammography. Nearly two thirds of facilities interpreted screening mammography examinations on-site, whereas 91% of facilities interpreted diagnostic examinations on-site. Only three facilities (7%) interpreted screening examinations on line as they were performed. Approximately half of facilities reported using some type of double interpretation, although the methods of double interpretation and the fraction of cases double-interpreted varied widely across facilities. On average, approximately 15% of screening examinations and 10% of diagnostic examinations were reported as being double-interpreted.

METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare study included cancer survivors diagnosed in 2004, 2-3 years post-cancer diagnosis, in fee-for-service Medicare. We examined (1) provider specialties (primary care providers (PCPs), oncology specialists, other specialists) visited post-hospitalization, (2) role of provider specialties in chronic and acute condition management, and (3) an ambulatory care coordination measure. Outcome measures covered (1) visits post-hospitalization for nine conditions, (2) chronic disease management (lipid profile, diabetic eye exam, diabetic monitoring), and (3) acute condition management (electrocardiogram (EKG) for congestive heart failure (CHF), imaging for CHF, EKG for transient ischemic attack, cholecystectomy, hip fracture repair). RESULTS: Among 8661 cancer survivors, patients were more likely to visit PCPs than oncologists or other specialists following hospitalizations for 8/9 conditions. Patients visiting a PCP (vs. not) were more likely to receive recommended care for 3/3 chronic and 1/5 acute condition indicators. Patients visiting a nother specialist (vs. not) were more likely to receive recommended care for 3/3 chronic and 2/5 acute condition indicators.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the interpretive performance of digital and film-screen mammography differs. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Mammography facilities in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. PARTICIPANTS: 329,261 women aged 40 to 79 years underwent 869 286 mammograms (231 034 digital; 638 252 film-screen). MEASUREMENTS: Invasive cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ diagnosed within 12 months of a digital or film-screen examination and calculation of mammography sensitivity, specificity, cancer detection rates, and tumor outcomes. RESULTS: Overall, cancer detection rates and tumor characteristics were similar for digital and film-screen mammography, but the sensitivity and specificity of each modality varied by age, tumor characteristics, breast density, and menopausal status. Compared with film-screen mammography, the sensitivity of digital mammography was significantly higher for women aged 60 to 69 years (89.9% vs. 83.0%; P = 0.014) and those with estrogen receptor-negative cancer (78.5% vs. 65.8%; P = 0.016); borderline significantly higher for women aged 40 to 49 years (82.4% vs. 75.6%; P = 0.071), those with extremely dense breasts (83.6% vs. 68.1%; P = 0.051), and pre- or perimenopausal women (87.1% vs. 81.7%; P = 0.057); and borderline significantly lower for women aged 50 to 59 years (80.5% vs. 85.1%; P = 0.097).

We evaluated methods for addressing confounding in treatment and survival of patients with early-stage prostate cancer in observational data and compared findings with those from a benchmark randomized clinical trial. METHODS: We selected 14 302 early-stage prostate cancer patients who were aged 66-74 years and had been treated with radical prostatectomy or conservative management from linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data from January 1, 1995, through December 31, 2003. Eligibility criteria were similar to those from a clinical trial used to benchmark our analyses. Survival was measured through December 31, 2007, by use of Cox proportional hazards models. We compared results from the benchmark trial with results from models with observational data by use of traditional multivariable survival analysis, propensity score adjustment, and instrumental variable analysis. RESULTS: Prostate cancer patients receiving conservative management were more likely to be older, nonwhite, and single and to have more advanced disease than patients receiving radical prostatectomy. In a multivariable survival analysis, conservative management was associated with greater risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.27 to 2.00) and all-cause mortality (HR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.35 to 1.59) than radical prostatectomy. Propensity score adjustments resulted in similar patient characteristics across treatment groups, although survival results were similar to traditional multivariable survival analyses. Results for the same comparison from the instrumental variable approach, which theoretically equalizes both observed and unobserved patient characteristics across treatment groups, differed from the traditional multivariable and propensity score results but were consistent with findings from the subset of elderly patient with early-stage disease in the trial (ie, conservative management vs radical prostatectomy: for prostate cancer-specific mortality, HR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.08 to 6.73; for all-cause mortality, HR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.46 to 2.59).

METHODS: Data from 3675 individuals aged 65 and older responding to the 2004 National Adult Immunization Survey, which included a CRC screening module, were analyzed in 2005-2006. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize patterns of use of preventive services, and to assess reasons for non-use. Polytomous logistic regression modeling was used to identify predictors of specific use patterns. RESULTS: Thirty-seven percent of respondents were current with all three preventive services; 10% were not current with any. Preventive services use varied by demographic and healthcare utilization characteristics. Having a recent visit to a doctor or other health provider was the most consistent predictor of use. Concern about side effects was the most frequently cited reason for not having an influenza vaccination (25%), while not knowing that the preventive service was needed was the most common reason for non-use of pneumonia vaccination (47%) and CRC tests (44% FOBT, 51% sigmoidoscopy, 47% colonoscopy). CONCLUSIONS: Rates of influenza and pneumonia vaccination and CRC screening are suboptimal. This is especially apparent when examining the combined use of these services.

The distributions of histopathological tumour size and lymph node involvement in invasive cases did not differ between the two regions for interval cancers diagnosed during the first year after screening. In contrast, in the second year after screening, tumour characteristics remained stable in Norway but became prognostically more favorable in NC. CONCLUSION: Even when applying a common set of definitions of interval cancer, the ICR was lower in Norway than in NC. Different definitions of interval cancer did not influence the ICR within Norway or NC.

Women were followed-up for 1 year. For initial screens, recall rate was significantly higher in BCSC (17.6%) than in Copenhagen (4.3%) and Funen (3.1%). Sensitivity was fairly similar in BCSC (91.8%) and Copenhagen (90.5%) and Funen (92.5%). At subsequent screens, recall rates were 8.8%, 1.8% and 1.4% in BCSC, Copenhagen and Funen, respectively. The BCSC sensitivity (82.3%) was lower compared with that in Copenhagen (88.9%) and Funen (86.9%), but when stratified by time since last screen, the sensitivity was similar. For both initial and subsequent screenings, the specificity of screening in BCSC (83.2% and 91.6%) was significantly lower than that in Copenhagen (96.6% and 98.8%) and Funen (97.9% and 99.2%). By taking time since last screen into account, it was found that American and Danish women had the same probability of having their asymptomatic cancers detected at screening. However, the majority of women free of asymptomatic cancers experienced more harms in terms of false-positive findings in the US than in Denmark.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Breast,Healthcare Delivery Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=25944711,0,1,0,0

Recall rates were defined as the percentage of screening mammograms with a recommendation for further evaluation including diagnostic mammography, ultrasound, clinical examination or biopsy, and cancer detection rates including invasive cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ diagnosed within 12 months of a screening mammogram. All results were stratified by whether examinations were first or subsequent and adjusted to a standard age distribution. Among women who underwent a first screening mammogram, 13.3% of women in the USA versus 7.2% of women in the UK were recalled for further evaluation (relative risk for recall 1.9; 95% CI 1.8-1.9). For subsequent examinations recall rates were approximately 50% lower, but remained twice as high in the USA as in the UK. A similar percentage of women underwent biopsy in each setting, but rates of percutaneous biopsy were lower and rates of open surgical biopsy were higher in the USA. Women undergo screening approximately every 18 months in the USA and every 36 months in the UK. Based on a 20-year period of screening, the estimated percentage of women who would be recalled for additional testing was nearly threefold higher in the USA. The number of cancers detected was also higher in the USA (55 versus 43), and most of the increase was in the detection of small invasive and in situ cancers. The numbers of large cancers detected ( > 2 cm) were very similar between the two countries. Recall rates are approximately two to three times higher in the USA than in the UK. Importantly, despite less frequent screening in the USA, there are no substantial differences in the rates of detection of large cancers.

With this proliferation in measurement of health literacy in research, it has become increasingly important to understand how various health literacy tools perform in specific populations. Our objective was to compare the performance of two widely used tests, the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (S-TOFHLA) and the Newest Vital Sign (NVS) among and between a sample of English and Spanish-speaking patients. Adults (N = 402) ages 50-75 years participating in a trial to promote colorectal cancer screening completed in-person interviews which included both measures of health literacy. In the full sample, the tests were moderately correlated (r = 0.69, p < .0001); however, there was a stronger correlation among those completing the test in Spanish (r = 0.83) as compared with English (r = 0.58, p < .0001). English speakers more often were categorized as having adequate literacy by the S-TOFHLA as compared with the NVS, whereas Spanish speakers scored consistently low on both instruments. These findings indicate that the categorization of participants into levels of literacy is likely to vary, depending on whether the NVS or S-TOFHLA is used for assessment, a factor which researchers should be aware of when selecting literacy assessments.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Colorectal, Digestive Organs",Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26147770,0,0,0,0

Participants (n = 704) were randomly assigned to view either a narrative or nonnarrative film containing the same information about how cervical cancer could be prevented or detected, and they were re-contacted 2 weeks and 6 months later. RESULTS: At 2 weeks, both films produced a significant increase in cervical cancer-related knowledge and attitudes, but these effects were significantly higher for the narrative film. At 6 months, viewers of both films retained greater than baseline knowledge and more positive attitudes toward Papanicolaou (Pap) tests, but women who saw the narrative were significantly more likely to have had or scheduled a Pap test.

Med Sci Sports Exerc 2017;49(3):617-624",2017,Comparison of accelerometry methods for estimating physical activity,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to compare physical activity estimates across different accelerometer wear locations, wear time protocols, and data processing techniques. METHODS: A convenience sample of middle-age to older women wore a GT3X+ accelerometer at the wrist and hip for 7 d. Physical activity estimates were calculated using three data processing techniques: single-axis cut points, raw vector magnitude thresholds, and machine learning algorithms applied to the raw data from the three axes. Daily estimates were compared for the 321 women using generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: A total of 1420 d were analyzed. Compliance rates for the hip versus wrist location only varied by 2.7%. All differences between techniques, wear locations, and wear time protocols were statistically different (P < 0.05). Mean minutes per day in physical activity varied from 22 to 67 depending on location and method. On the hip, the 1952-count cut point found at least 150 min.wk of physical activity in 22% of participants, raw vector magnitude found 32%, and the machine-learned algorithm found 74% of participants with 150 min of walking/running per week. The wrist algorithms found 59% and 60% of participants with 150 min of physical activity per week using the raw vector magnitude and machine-learned techniques, respectively. When the wrist device was worn overnight, up to 4% more participants met guidelines. CONCLUSION: Estimates varied by 52% across techniques and by as much as 41% across wear locations. Findings suggest that researchers should be cautious when comparing physical activity estimates from different studies. Efforts to standardize accelerometry-based estimates of physical activity are needed. A first step might be to report on multiple procedures until a consensus is achieved.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,"Behavioral Research Program, Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27755355,0,0,0,0

OBJECTIVE: To compare screening mammography performance between the United States and the United Kingdom among similar-aged women. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Women aged 50 years or older were identified who underwent 5.5 million mammograms from January 1, 1996, to December 31, 1999, within 3 large-scale mammography registries or screening programs: the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC, n = 978 591) and National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP, n = 613 388) in the United States; and the National Health Service Breast Screening Program (NHSBSP, n = 3.94 million) in the United Kingdom. A total of 27 612 women were diagnosed with breast cancer (invasive or ductal carcinoma in situ) within 12 months of screening among the 3 groups. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Recall rates (recommendation for further evaluation including diagnostic imaging, ultrasound, clinical examination, or biopsy) and cancer detection rates were calculated for first and subsequent mammograms, and within 5-year age groups. RESULTS: Recall rates were approximately twice as high in the United States than in the United Kingdom for all age groups; however, cancer rates were similar. Among women aged 50 to 54 years who underwent a first screening mammogram, 14.4% in the BCSC and 12.5% in the NBCCEDP were recalled for further evaluation vs only 7.6% in the NHSBSP. Cancer detection rates per 1000 mammogram screens were 5.8, 5.9, and 6.3, in the BCSC, NBCCEDP, and NHSBSP, respectively. Recall rates were lower for subsequent examinations in all 3 settings but remained twice as high in the United States. A similar percentage of women underwent biopsy in each setting, but rates of percutaneous biopsy were lower and open surgical biopsy higher in the United States. Open surgical biopsies not resulting in a diagnosis of cancer (negative biopsies) were twice as high in the United States than in the United Kingdom. Based on a 10-year period of screening 1000 women aged 50 to 59 years, 477, 433, and 175 women in the BCSC, NBCCEDP, and NHSBSP, respectively, would be recalled; and for women aged 60 to 69 years, 396, 334, and 133 women, respectively.

METHODS: Data for 1785 cancer survivors were obtained from the 2007 National Health Interview Survey and CAM supplement. The prevalence and associations of CAM use in the previous 12 months were compared among underweight/normal weight, overweight, and obese adult cancer survivors. RESULTS: Nearly 90% of cancer survivors used at least one type of CAM therapy in the 12 months preceding the survey. Those who were overweight, but not obese, were more likely to use a CAM modality compared to normal/underweight respondents. Over two thirds (71%) reported using CAM therapy for general health and wellness and 39.3% used CAM because a health care provider recommended it. Disclosure rates of CAM use to conventional medical professionals varied widely by CAM modality. CONCLUSIONS: An overwhelming majority of US cancer survivors use CAM for a variety of reasons. Overweight cancer survivors may be more likely to use CAM than those who are underweight, normal weight, or obese.

The physiological function of estrogen is primarily mediated by estrogen receptor alpha, encoded by ESR1. Consequently, several studies have investigated whether variation at the ESR1 locus is associated with risk of EC, with conflicting results. We performed comprehensive fine-mapping analyses of 3633 genotyped and imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 6607 EC cases and 37 925 controls. There was evidence of an EC risk signal located at a potential alternative promoter of the ESR1 gene (lead SNP rs79575945, P=1.86x10(-5)), which was stronger for cancers of endometrioid subtype (P=3.76x10(-6)). Bioinformatic analysis suggests that this risk signal is in a functionally important region targeting ESR1, and eQTL analysis found that rs79575945 was associated with expression of SYNE1, a neighbouring gene. In summary, we have identified a single EC risk signal located at ESR1, at study-wide significance. Given SNPs located at this locus have been associated with risk for breast cancer, also a hormonally driven cancer, this study adds weight to the rationale for performing informed candidate fine-scale genetic studies across cancer types.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Endometrial, Female Genital Organs",Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26330482,0,1,0,0

Popul Health Metr 2010;8:20",2010,Consistency and precision of cancer reporting in a multiwave national panel survey,"BACKGROUND: Many epidemiological studies rely on self-reported information, the accuracy of which is critical for unbiased estimates of population health. Previously, accuracy has been analyzed by comparing self-reports to other sources, such as cancer registries. Cancer is believed to be a well-reported condition. This paper uses novel panel data to test the consistency of cancer reports for respondents with repeated self-reports. METHODS: Data come from 978 adults who reported having been diagnosed with cancer in at least one of four waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, 1999-2005. Consistency of cancer occurrence reports and precision of timing of onset were studied as a function of individual and cancer-related characteristics using logistic and ordered logistic models. RESULTS: Almost 30% of respondents gave inconsistent cancer reports, meaning they said they never had cancer after having said they did have cancer in a previous interview; 50% reported the year of diagnosis with a discrepancy of two or more years. More recent cancers were reported with a higher consistency and timing precision; cervical cancer was reported more inaccurately than other cancer types. Demographic and socio-economic factors were only weak predictors of reporting quality. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that retrospective reports of cancer contain significant measurement error. The errors, however, are fairly random across different social groups, meaning that the results based on the data are not systematically biased by socio-economic factors. Even for health events as salient as cancer, researchers should exercise caution about the presumed accuracy of self-reports, especially if the timing of diagnosis is an important covariate.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Cervix, Ovary, Uterus, Lymphoma, Prostate, Melanoma, Female Genital Organs, Lung, Lymph/Blood, Male Genital Organs, Skin",Healthcare Delivery Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=20579346,0,1,0,0

Distress (Symptom Checklist-90-Revised, Impact of Event Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale) was assessed at four assessments; one before and three after the decision to have genetic testing. The majority of women (n = 100) had testing. The follow-up assessments occurred at 1 week after receiving results (or 3-4 months after baseline if testing was not elected), and then at 3 and 6 months after the second assessment. Coping (Brief COPE) was measured at the first and third assessments. RESULTS: Coping was relatively stable over time and did not vary as a function of genetic test results. Active coping strategies were used more often by women with a personal cancer history than by women without cancer. Use of avoidant coping was reliably and positively associated with distress over time independent of cancer history and test result. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of specific coping styles that were associated with more or less distress is useful as a means of identifying and targeting coping interventions and predicting which participants may be at risk for distress","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Breast,"Outcomes Research, Applied Research Program",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=19124622,1,1,1,1

Correlates of markers of inflammation in breast cancer survivors have not been thoroughly evaluated. METHODS: Using data from, the Health, Eating, Activity, and Lifestyle (HEAL) Study (a population-based, multiethnic prospective cohort study of female breast cancer patients) we evaluated the associations between circulating markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP] and serum amyloid A [SAA], measured approximately 31 months after diagnosis) and several demographic, lifestyle, and clinical characteristics in 741 disease-free breast cancer survivors. Analysis of variance and regression methods were used for statistical analyses of log-transformed values of CRP and SAA. RESULTS: After adjusting for age, BMI, ethnicity, and study site, higher concentrations of CRP were associated with increasing concentration of SAA (P-trend < 0.0001), increasing age (P-trend < 0.0001), increasing BMI (P-trend < 0.0001), increasing waist circumference (P-trend < 0.0001), positive history of heart failure (P = 0.0007), decreasing physical activity (P-trend = 0.005), Hispanic ethnicity (P = 0.05 vs. non-Hispanic white), and current smoking (P = 0.03 vs. never smoking). Vitamin E supplementation (P = 0.0005), tamoxifen use (P = 0.008), and radiation treatment (compared to no chemotherapy or radiation; P = 0.04) were associated with reduced CRP. Associations of CRP with clinical characteristics were not significant in the adjusted models. In a multivariate analysis, CRP showed significant associations with waist circumference, BMI, age, history of heart failure, tamoxifen use, and vitamin E supplementation (R (2) = 0.35). Similar, yet fewer, associations were observed for SAA (R (2) = 0.19). CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights important correlates of inflammatory status in breast cancer patients.

There are few national-level data on rates of repeat, on-schedule mammography, and on the prevalence and correlates of repeat mammography.

METHODS: Analyses were from data for women ages 45 to 75 in the 2002 to 2003 Health Information and National Trends Survey (HINTS 2003; N = 1,581). The two dependent variables were self-report of repeat mammography (two exams on schedule, based on an every-other-year interval) and recent mammography only (one mammogram within the past 2 years). RESULTS: The prevalence of recent mammography was 81.6% (95% confidence interval, 79.1-84.1) and for repeat mammography was 72.2% (95% confidence interval, 69.0-75.4). An access to care variable combining insurance coverage and regular source of care was the strongest sociodemographic correlate of both mammography indicators. Most other sociodemographic variables were not associated with mammography status. Five psychosocial/behavioral variables were associated with both mammography indicators (smoking status, attention to health information, knowledge of screening interval, worry about breast cancer, and recent mood status). Correlates were very similar for repeat and recent mammography. CONCLUSIONS: Although access to care had the strongest association with mammography, psychosocial and behavioral variables did better as a group than the sociodemographic variables.

Oesophageal adenocarcinoma and its precursor, Barrett's oesophagus provides an excellent opportunity to highlight this issue since cancer is uncommon even among individuals with documented Barrett's oesophagus. This review provides a brief introduction to economic analysis in healthcare and summarizes published studies of the cost-effectiveness of strategies to reduce mortality from cancer. Current best estimates highlight the cost-effectiveness of endoscopic ablation among patients with Barrett's oesophagus and high-grade dysplasia and the low cost-effectiveness of ablation among patients without dysplasia. The cost-effectiveness of ablation among patients with Barrett's and low-grade dysplasia is poorly defined due to the ambiguity of diagnosing dysplasia, the unknown risk of cancer among patients with low-grade dysplasia, and the uncertain durability of ablation to maintain remission from metaplasia and dysplasia and prevent cancer.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Esophagus, Digestive Organs",Surveillance Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=25743456,0,1,0,0

METHODS: We used computer-based models to assess the cost-effectiveness of a variety of cervical-cancer screening strategies in India, Kenya, Peru, South Africa, and Thailand. Primary data were combined with data from the literature to estimate age-specific incidence and mortality rates for cancer and the effectiveness of screening for and treatment of precancerous lesions. We assessed the direct medical, time, and program-related costs of strategies that differed according to screening test, targeted age and frequency, and number of clinic visits required. Single-visit strategies involved the assumption that screening and treatment could be provided in the same day. Outcomes included the lifetime risk of cancer, years of life saved, lifetime costs, and cost-effectiveness ratios (cost per year of life saved). RESULTS: The most cost-effective strategies were those that required the fewest visits, resulting in improved follow-up testing and treatment. Screening women once in their lifetime, at the age of 35 years, with a one-visit or two-visit screening strategy involving visual inspection of the cervix with acetic acid or DNA testing for human papillomavirus (HPV) in cervical cell samples, reduced the lifetime risk of cancer by approximately 25 to 36 percent, and cost less than 500 dollars per year of life saved. Relative cancer risk declined by an additional 40 percent with two screenings (at 35 and 40 years of age), resulting in a cost per year of life saved that was less than each country's per capita gross domestic product--a very cost-effective result, according to the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-cancer genomic analysis for the inflammation pathway based on 48 genome-wide association studies within the National Cancer Institute GAME-ON Network across five common cancer sites, with a total of 64 591 cancer patients and 74 467 control patients. Subset-based meta-analysis was used to account for possible disease heterogeneity, and hierarchical modeling was employed to estimate the effect of the subcomponents within the inflammation pathway. The network was visualized by enrichment map. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: We identified three pleiotropic loci within the inflammation pathway, including one novel locus in Ch12q24 encoding SH2B3 (rs3184504), which reached GWAS significance with a P value of 1.78 x 10(-8), and it showed an association with lung cancer (P = 2.01 x 10(-6)), colorectal cancer (GECCO P = 6.72x10(-6); CORECT P = 3.32x10(-5)), and breast cancer (P = .009). We also identified five key subpathway components with genetic variants that are relevant for the risk of these five cancer sites: inflammatory response for colorectal cancer (P = .006), inflammation related cell cycle gene for lung cancer (P = 1.35x10(-6)), and activation of immune response for ovarian cancer (P = .009). In addition, sequence variations in immune system development played a role in breast cancer etiology (P = .001) and innate immune response was involved in the risk of both colorectal (P = .022) and ovarian cancer (P = .003).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approvals and patient consent were obtained. A mailed survey was sent to 53 eligible mammography facilities in three states (Washington, New Hampshire, and Colorado). Survey questions assessed equipment and staffing availability, as well as appointment waiting times for screening and diagnostic mammography services. Criterion-related content and construct validity were obtained first by means of a national advisory committee of academic, scientific, and clinical colleagues in mammography that reviewed literature on existing surveys and second by pilot testing a series of draft surveys among community mammography facilities not inclusive of the study facilities. The final survey results were independently double entered into a relational database with programmed data checks. The data were sent encrypted by means of file transfer protocol to a central analytical center at Group Health Cooperative. A two-sided P value with alpha = .05 was considered to show statistical significance in all analyses. RESULTS: Forty-five of 53 eligible mammography facilities (85%) returned the survey. Shortages of radiologists relative to the mammographic volume were found in 44% of mammography facilities overall, with shortages of radiologists higher in not-for-profit versus for-profit facilities (60% vs 28% reported). Shortages of Mammography Quality Standards Act-qualified technologists were reported by 20% of facilities, with 46% reporting some level of difficulty in maintaining qualified technologists.

Our aim was to use a genome-wide gene-environment interaction analysis to identify genetic modifiers of CRC risk associated with use of MHT. METHODS: We included 10 835 postmenopausal women (5419 cases and 5416 controls) from 10 studies. We evaluated use of any MHT, oestrogen-only (E-only) and combined oestrogen-progestogen (E+P) hormone preparations. To test for multiplicative interactions, we applied the empirical Bayes (EB) test as well as the Wald test in conventional case-control logistic regression as primary tests. The Cocktail test was used as secondary test. RESULTS: The EB test identified a significant interaction between rs964293 at 20q13.2/CYP24A1 and E+P (interaction OR (95% CIs)=0.61 (0.52-0.72), P=4.8 x 10(-9)).

OBJECTIVE: Using cancer patients as an example, we compared comorbid conditions identified: 1) on the discharge facesheet versus full hospital medical record and 2) in the hospital record versus Medicare claims, both precancer diagnosis and associated with a cancer treatment-related index hospitalization. METHODS: We used data from 1995 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results patterns of care studies for 1,382 patients. Comorbid conditions were ascertained from the hospital record associated with the most definitive cancer treatment and Medicare claims. We calculated the prevalence for and assessed concordances among 12 conditions derived from the hospital record facesheet; full hospital record; Medicare claims precancer diagnosis, with and without a rule-out algorithm applied; and Medicare claims associated with an index hospitalization. RESULTS: The proportion of patients with one or more comorbid conditions varied by data source, from 21% for the facesheet to 85% for prediagnosis Medicare claims without the rule-out algorithm. Condition prevalences were substantially lower for the facesheet compared with the full hospital record. For prediagnosis Medicare claims, condition prevalences were more than 1.7 times greater in the absence of an algorithm to screen for rule-out diagnoses. Measures assessing concordance between the full hospital record and prediagnosis Medicare claims (rule-out algorithm applied) showed modest agreement. CONCLUSIONS: The hospital record and Medicare claims are complementary data sources for identifying comorbid conditions. Comorbidity is greatly underascertained when derived only from the facesheet of the hospital record. Investigators using Part B Medicare claims to measure comorbidity should remove conditions that are listed for purposes of generating bills but are not true comorbidities.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,"Health Services and Economics Branch, Applied Research Program",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=17001263,0,1,0,0

A stratified random sample of non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic women age 20 years and older was selected from cases reported by 11 SEER registries. Analyses of the association between vulvar cancer and key demographic, clinical, and hospital characteristics by stage were performed. Cox proportional hazards was used to estimate the odds of death due to cancer. All estimates were weighted, and analyses were conducted with SUDAAN. RESULTS: Ninety percent of cases were diagnosed with in situ or early-stage invasive disease. Older patients were more likely to present at advanced stages. Twenty-five percent of women with Stage III-IV vulvar cancer received chemotherapy plus radiation. We noted widespread use of radical local excision among women with Stage I/II cancer, but 46-54% with invasive disease underwent a radical or total vulvectomy.

METHODS: We prospectively followed 77,451 women from the Nurses' Health Study (1992-2010) and 106,452 women from the Nurses' Health Study II (1993-2011). Depression was defined as having one or more of the following: a 5-item Mental Health Index (MHI-5) score</=52, antidepressant use, or physician-diagnosed depression. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between depression and incident ovarian cancer. RESULTS: We documented 698 incident cases of epithelial ovarian cancer during follow-up. In multivariable analyses, depression assessed 2-4years before cancer diagnosis was associated with a modestly higher incidence of ovarian cancer (HR=1.30, 95% CI 1.05-1.60). Compared to women with persistent negative depression status, the adjusted HRs were 1.34 (95% CI 1.01-1.76) for women with persistent positive depression status and 1.28 (95% CI 0.88-1.85) for women with worsening depression status over follow-up.

METHODS: A total of 857 breast cancer survivors, stages in situ-IIIa, from the Health, Eating, Activity, and Lifestyle (HEAL) Study were eligible. Survivors completed the PFS-R, SF-36, and a sexual health scale approximately 3 years after diagnosis. Multivariate analysis of covariance was used to examine five fatigue severity cut-score models, controlling for demographics, clinical characteristics, comorbidity, and antidepressant use. Multivariate regression was used to examine HRQOL decrements by cut-score category. RESULTS: Analyses supported two similar fatigue severity cut-score models for the PFS-R and PFS-12: Model A.) none (0), mild (1-3), moderate (4-6), and severe (7-10); and Model D.) none (0), mild (1-2), moderate (3-5), and severe (6-10). For every threshold increase in fatigue severity, clinically meaningful decrements in physical, mental, and sexual health scores were observed, supporting construct validity of the fatigue cut-scores.

J Natl Cancer Inst 2002;94(20):1546-1554",2002,Detection of ductal carcinoma in situ in women undergoing screening mammography,"BACKGROUND: With the large number of women having mammography-an estimated 28.4 million U.S. women aged 40 years and older in 1998-the percentage of cancers detected as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), which has an uncertain prognosis, has increased. We pooled data from seven regional mammography registries to determine the percentage of mammographically detected cancers that are DCIS and the rate of DCIS per 1000 mammograms. METHODS: We analyzed data on 653 833 mammograms from 540 738 women between 40 and 84 years of age who underwent screening mammography at facilities participating in the National Cancer Institute's Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) throughout 1996 and 1997. Mammography results were linked to population-based cancer and pathology registries. We calculated the percentage of screen-detected breast cancers that were DCIS, the rate of screen-detected DCIS per 1000 mammograms by age and by previous mammography status, and the sensitivity of screening mammography. Statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: A total of 3266 cases of breast cancer were identified, 591 DCIS and 2675 invasive breast cancer. The percentage of screen-detected breast cancers that were DCIS decreased with age (from 28.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 23.9% to 32.5%] for women aged 40-49 years to 16.0% [95% CI = 13.3% to 18.7%] for women aged 70-84 years). However, the rate of screen-detected DCIS cases per 1000 mammograms increased with age (from 0.56 [95% CI = 0.41 to 0.70] for women aged 40-49 years to 1.07 [95% CI = 0.87 to 1.27] for women aged 70-84 years). Sensitivity of screening mammography in all age groups combined was higher for detecting DCIS (86.0% [95% CI = 83.2% to 88.8%]) than it was for detecting invasive breast cancer (75.1% [95% CI = 73.5% to 76.8%]). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, approximately 1 in every 1300 screening mammography examinations leads to a diagnosis of DCIS.

This study sought to identify patient/tumor, physician, hospital, and geographic factors associated with oxaliplatin use among older patients. METHODS: Individuals diagnosed at age > 65 with stage II or III CRC from 2004 through 2007 undergoing surgical resection and receiving adjuvant chemotherapy were identified using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results program (SEER)-Medicare database, which includes patient/tumor and hospital characteristics. Physician information was obtained from the American Medical Association. Poisson regression was used to identify independent predictors of oxaliplatin receipt. The discriminatory ability of each category of characteristics to predict oxaliplatin receipt was assessed by comparing the area under the receiver operating curve from logistic regression models. RESULTS: We identified 4388 individuals who underwent surgical resection at 773 hospitals and received chemotherapy from 1517 physicians. Adjuvant oxaliplatin use was higher among stage III (colon = 56%, rectum = 51%) compared to stage II patients (colon = 37%, rectum = 35%). Overall, patients who were older; diagnosed before 2006; separated, divorced, or widowed; living in a higher poverty census tract or in the East or Midwest; or with higher levels of comorbidity were less likely to receive oxaliplatin. Patient factors and calendar year accounted for most of the variation in oxaliplatin receipt (area under the curve = 75.8%).

The goal of this study was to examine the prevalence of and factors associated with this smoking-induced deprivation among adult smokers in China. METHODS: The data came from Waves 1-3 of the International Tobacco Control (ITC) China Survey, conducted from 2006 to 2009 among urban adults aged 18 years or older in China. We focus on the samples of current smokers from six cities (N=7981). Smoking-induced deprivation was measured with the survey question, ""In the last six months, have you spent money on cigarettes that you knew would be better spent on household essentials like food?"" We examined whether sociodemographic factors, smoking intensity and price paid per pack of cigarettes were associated with smoking-induced deprivation using generalised estimating equations modelling. FINDINGS: 7.3% of smokers reported smoking-induced deprivation due to purchasing cigarettes. Low-income and middle-income smokers were more likely to have smoking-induced deprivation compared with high-income smokers (adjusted OR (AOR)=2.06, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.31; AOR=1.44, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.69); smokers living in Shenyang (AOR=1.68, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.24) and Yinchuan (AOR=2.50, 95% CI 1.89 to 3.32) were more likely to have smoking-induced deprivation compared with smokers living in Beijing. Retired smokers were less likely to have smoking-induced deprivation compared with employed smokers (AOR=0.67, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.87). There was no statistically significant relationship between smoking intensity, price paid per pack of cigarettes and smoking-induced deprivation. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that certain groups of smokers in China acknowledge spending money on cigarettes that could be better spent on household essentials.

There are many benefits to the use of competencies in practice-based education such as the establishment of rigorous standards as well as providing an additional metrics for development and growth. As the first aim of a D&I training grant, an exploratory study was conducted to establish a new set of D&I competencies to guide training in D&I research. METHODS: Based upon existing D&I training literature, the leadership team compiled an initial list of competencies. The research team then engaged 16 additional colleagues in the area of D&I science to provide suggestions to the initial list. The competency list was then additionally narrowed to 43 unique competencies following feedback elicited from these D&I researchers. Three hundred additional D&I researchers were then invited via email to complete a card sort in which the list of competencies were sorted into three categories of experience levels. Participants had previous first-hand experience with D&I or knowledge translation training programs in the past. Participants reported their self-identified D&I expertise level as well as the country in which their home institution is located. A mean score was calculated for each competency based on their experience level categorization. From these mean scores, beginner-, intermediate-, and advanced-level tertiles were created for the competencies. RESULTS: The card sort request achieved a 41 % response rate (n = 124). The list of 43 competencies was organized into four broad domains and sorted based on their experience level score. Eleven competencies were classified into the ""Beginner"" category, 27 into ""Intermediate,"" and 5 into ""Advanced."" CONCLUSIONS: Education and training developers can use this competency list to formalize future trainings in D&I research, create more evidence-informed curricula, and enable overall capacity building and accompanying metrics in the field of D&I training and research.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26264453,0,0,0,0

Much of the population does not consume the recommended servings of FV daily. This paper describes the development of psychosocial measures of FV intake for inclusion in the U.S. National Cancer Institute's 2007 Food Attitudes and Behaviors Survey. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study among 3,397 adults from the United States. Scales included conventional constructs shown to be correlated with fruit and vegetable intake (FVI) in prior studies (e.g., self-efficacy, social support), and novel constructs that have been measured in few- to- no studies (e.g., views on vegetarianism, neophobia). FVI was assessed with an eight-item screener. Exploratory factor analysis, Cronbach's alpha, and regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Psychosocial scales with Cronbach's alpha >/=0.68 were self-efficacy, social support, perceived barriers and benefits of eating FVs, views on vegetarianism, autonomous and controlled motivation, and preference for FVs. Conventional scales that were associated (p<0.05) with FVI were self-efficacy, social support, and perceived barriers to eating FVs. Novel scales that were associated (p<0.05) with FVI were autonomous motivation, and preference for vegetables. Other single items that were associated (p<0.05) with FVI included knowledge of FV recommendations, FVI ""while growing up"", and daily water consumption.

SCT and other behavior theories were developed primarily to explain differences between individuals, but explanatory theories of within-person behavioral variability are increasingly needed as new technologies allow for intensive longitudinal measures and interventions adapted from these inputs. These within-person explanatory theoretical applications can be modeled as dynamical systems. SCT constructs, such as reciprocal determinism, are inherently dynamical in nature, but SCT has not been modeled as a dynamical system. This paper describes the development of a dynamical system model of SCT using fluid analogies and control systems principles drawn from engineering. Simulations of this model were performed to assess if the model performed as predicted based on theory and empirical studies of SCT. This initial model generates precise and testable quantitative predictions for future intensive longitudinal research. Dynamic modeling approaches provide a rigorous method for advancing health behavior theory development and refinement and for guiding the development of more potent and efficient interventions.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27848208,0,0,0,0

DESIGN: A large, population-based, prospective longitudinal telephone survey. SETTING: California, Florida, Illinois, and New York. PARTICIPANTS: Elderly (65+ years) women identified from Medicare claims as having had an incident breast cancer surgery in 2003. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported incidence of lymphedema symptoms, formal diagnosis of lymphedema, treatments for lymphedema. RESULTS: Of the 450 breast cancer survivors with lymphedema who participated in the study, 290 (64.4%) were formally diagnosed with the condition by a physician. An additional 160 (35.6%) reported symptoms consistent with lymphedema (ie, arm swelling on the side of surgery that is absent on the contralateral arm) but were not formally diagnosed. Of those who reported being diagnosed by a physician, 39 (13.4%) received complete decongestive therapy that included multiple components of treatment (ie, manual lymphatic drainage, bandaging with short stretch bandages, the use of compression sleeves, skin care, and remedial exercises); 24 (8.3%) were treated with manual lymphatic drainage only; 162 (55.9%) used bandages, compression garments, or a pneumatic pump only; 8 (2.8%) relied solely on skin care or exercise to relieve symptoms; and 65 (22.4%) received no treatment at all. Multivariate regressions revealed that race (African American), lower income, and lower levels of social support increased a woman's probability of having undiagnosed lymphedema. Even when they were formally diagnosed, African American women were more likely to receive no treatment or to be treated with bandages/compression only rather than to receive the multimodality, complete decongestive therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Lymphedema is a disabling chronic condition related to breast cancer treatment. Our results suggest that a substantial proportion of persons reporting symptoms were not formally diagnosed with the condition, thereby reducing their opportunity for treatment. The variation in rehabilitation treatments received by women who were formally diagnosed with the condition by a physician suggests that lymphedema might not have been optimally addressed in many cases despite the availability of effective interventions.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Breast,Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=23684778,1,1,0,1

Poor bowel control has a detrimental impact on survivors' health-related quality of life (HRQOL). This analysis describes the dietary and behavioral adjustments used by CRC survivors to manage bowel dysfunction and compares adjustments used by survivors with permanent ostomy to those with anastomosis. METHODS: This mixed-methods analysis included pooled data from several studies that assessed HRQOL in CRC survivors. In all studies, CRC survivors with or without permanent ostomies (N = 856) were surveyed using the City of Hope Quality of Life Colorectal Cancer tool. Dietary adjustments were compared by ostomy status and by overall HRQOL score (high vs. low). Qualitative data from 13 focus groups and 30 interviews were analyzed to explore specific strategies used by survivors to manage bowel dysfunction. RESULTS: CRC survivors made substantial, permanent dietary, and behavioral adjustments after surgery, regardless of ostomy status. Survivors who took longer after surgery to become comfortable with their diet or regain their appetite were more likely to report worse HRQOL. Adjustments to control bowel function were divided into four major strategies: dietary adjustments, behavioral adjustments, exercise, and medication use. CONCLUSIONS: CRC survivors struggled with unpredictable bowel function and may fail to find a set of management strategies to achieve regularity. Understanding the myriad adjustments used by CRC survivors may lead to evidence-based interventions to foster positive adjustments after surgery and through long-term survivorship.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Colorectal, Digestive Organs",Office of Cancer Survivorship,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26159443,1,1,0,0

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Three-level regression models with random intercepts at the early care and education center and child level were used; all models were adjusted for child sex, age, and body mass index (calculated as kg/m(2)). RESULTS: Mean HEI-2010 total scores were 58 for lunches packed and 52 for lunches consumed, out of 100 possible points. Mean HEI component scores for packed and consumed lunches were lowest for greens and beans (6% and 8% of possible points), total vegetables (33% and 28%), seafood and plant proteins (33% and 29%), and whole grains (38% and 34%); and highest for empty calories (85% and 68% of possible points), total fruit (80% and 70%), whole fruit (79% and 64%), and total protein foods (76% and 69%). CONCLUSIONS: Parents of preschool children pack lunches with low dietary quality that lack vegetables, plant proteins, and whole grains, as measured by the HEI. Education of parents and care providers in early care and education centers is vital to ensure that preschoolers receive high dietary-quality meals that promote their preference for and knowledge of a healthy diet.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26190228,0,0,0,0

Population-based data on relative use of dietary supplements among cancer survivors compared to those without a cancer history is lacking. Our objective was to compare supplement use among those with and without cancer and among those with and without other chronic conditions, and to identify correlates of supplement use by cancer status. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, population-based survey of participants in the 2003 CAM supplement to the 2001 California Health Interview Survey. SUBJECTS: Participants reporting a cancer diagnosis on the 2001 California Health Interview Survey or newly reported diagnosis on the 2003 survey (n=1,844) plus a random oversampling of racial/ethnic minorities (n=7,343). MEASURES: Self-reported use of a multivitamin and 27 vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other natural products during the preceding 12 months. STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Logistic regression analyses were performed with control for potential confounders. RESULTS: Adults with cancer or other chronic conditions had higher prevalence of supplement use than those reporting no illness. The independent effect of cancer was associated with vitamin use, whereas living with other chronic conditions was associated with all types of supplement use, except multivitamins. Correlates of supplement use were similar between cancer survivors and cancer-free individuals-being a woman, advancing age, and greater physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake, and other CAM use. Among cancer survivors, non-Hispanic whites had the lowest prevalence of herbal supplement use. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that having a chronic medical condition is the major factor associated with supplement use. A diagnosis of cancer, by itself, does not have an independent effect on supplement use. This suggests that most supplement use among cancer survivors is directed at dealing with or preventing the exacerbation of a comorbid condition.

At 4 weeks of age, Pten(+/-) and wild-type mice were each divided into four treatment groups and fed AIN93G control diet, or AIN93G-based diet containing either 25,000 international units of VD(3) per kilogram of diet, 58% fat to induce obesity (high fat), or high fat and 25,000 international units of VD(3) per kilogram of diet. Mice were kept on these diets until they were sacrificed at week 28. Although VD(3) did not affect endometrial cancer risk, it inhibited obesity-induced increase in endometrial lesions. Specifically, high-fat diet increased focal glandular hyperplasia with atypia and malignant lesions from 58% in the control diet-fed Pten(+/-) mice to 78% in obese mice. Dietary VD(3) decreased the incidence of endometrial pathology in obese Pten(+/-) mice to 25% (P < 0.001). VD(3) altered the endometrial expression of 25-hydroxylase, 1alpha-hydroxylase, and vitamin D receptor in the wild-type and Pten(+/-) mice. Estrogen receptor-alpha mRNA levels were higher (P < 0.014) and progesterone receptor protein levels in the luminal epithelium were lower (P < 0.04) in the endometrium of control diet-fed Pten(+/-) than wild-type mice, but the expression of these receptors was not affected by the dietary exposures. VD(3) reversed the obesity-induced increase in osteopontin (P < 0.001) and significantly increased E-cadherin expression (P < 0.019) in the endometrium of obese Pten(+/-) mice. Our data confirm the known association between obesity and endometrial cancer risk. Dietary exposure to VD(3) inhibited the carcinogenic effect of obesity on the endometrium.

Med Care 2007;45(5):420-430",2007,Differences among the elderly in the treatment costs of colorectal cancer: how important is race?,"BACKGROUND: Medical expenditures adjusted for price differences are a barometer of total resources devoted to patient care and thus may reflect treatment differentials. OBJECTIVE: We sought to estimate costs of the surgical and adjuvant treatment phases of colorectal cancer (CRC) care and cost differences by race (African American-white) and other patient characteristics. METHODS: We used the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database for stage II-III rectal and stage III colon cancer cases diagnosed in 1992-1996 to track Medicare approved payments for fee-for-service beneficiaries 66 and older in surgical (within 3 months of diagnosis) and postsurgical phases (13 months after the surgical phase). Net costs adjusted for expected noncancer expenditures were estimated with generalized linear models using pooled CRC and non-CRC cohorts. Using model results, we projected adjusted net costs for different patient groups (eg, by race, age). RESULTS: Total unstandardized CRC costs for African American recipients were $44,199, a statistically significant 15% higher than for white recipients ($38,378). Adjusting for covariates and expected non-CRC costs decreased the estimate for African American recipients to $34,588, a statistically insignificant $974 (2.9%) more than white recipients. Differential expenditures by age, urban-rural setting, region, and neighborhood median income were all much larger than differences by race, although only region was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: African American CRC patients cost more than their white counterparts, but adjusted differences were nonsignificant and trivial. Several nonracial cost differences were considerably larger (but not all statistically significant), and suggest that future research pay more attention to these characteristics.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Colorectal, Digestive Organs","Health Services and Economics Branch, Office of the Associate Director, Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Progra, Surveillance Research Program, Applied Research Program",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=17446828,0,1,0,1

We compared patient characteristics and treatment selection between American men with screening-detected versus clinically diagnosed prostate cancers. METHODS: We evaluated 3,173 men with prostate cancer in the USA. Surveys and medical records provided information on demographics, socioeconomic status, comorbidities, symptoms, tumor characteristics, and treatment. We classified men presenting with symptoms of advanced cancer - bone pain, weight loss, or hematuria - as 'clinically diagnosed'; asymptomatic men and those with only lower urinary tract symptoms were considered 'screening-detected.' We used multivariate analyses to determine whether screening predicted receiving aggressive treatment for a clinically localized cancer. RESULTS: We classified 11% of cancers as being clinically diagnosed. Men with screening-detected cancers were more often non-Hispanic white (77% vs. 65%, P < 0.01), younger (36% < 65 years vs. 25%, P <or= 0.01), better educated (80% >or= high school vs. 67%, P < 0.01), healthier (18% excellent health vs. 10%, P < 0.01), and diagnosed with localized disease (90% vs. 75%, P < 0.01). Men with screening-detected localized cancers more often underwent aggressive treatment, 76% vs. 70%, P = 0.05. CONCLUSION: Most cancers were detected by screening in this American cohort.

We further hypothesized dynamic network influences such that external influence decreased over time, internal influence increased over time, and the role of opinion leader countries varied over time. In addition we develop two concepts: Susceptibility and influence that uncover the micro-level dynamics of network influence. Statistical analyses lend support to the influence of co-subscriptions on GLOBALink providing a conduit for inter-country influences on treaty ratification and some support for the dynamic hypotheses. Analyses of susceptibility and infection indicated particularly influential countries.

Research is needed to determine whether lean mass (LM) and fat mass (FM) independently relate to BMD in this patient group. METHODS: The Health, Eating, Activity, and Lifestyle Study participants included 599 women, ages 29-87 years, diagnosed from 1995-1999 with stage 0-IIIA breast cancer, who underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans approximately 6-months postdiagnosis. We calculated adjusted geometric means of total body BMD within quartiles (Q) of LM and FM. We also stratified LM-BMD associations by a fat mass index threshold that tracks with obesity (lower body fat: </= 12.9 kg/m2; higher body fat: >12.9 kg/m2) and stratified FM-BMD associations by appendicular lean mass index level corresponding with sarcopenia (non-sarcopenic: >/= 5.45 kg/m2 and sarcopenic: < 5.45 kg/m2). RESULTS: Higher LM (Q4 vs. Q1) was associated with higher total body BMD overall (1.12 g/cm2 vs. 1.07 g/cm2, p-trend < 0.0001), and among survivors with lower body fat (1.13 g/cm2 vs. 1.07 g/cm2, p-trend < 0.0001) and higher body fat (1.15 g/cm2 vs. 1.08 g/cm2, p-trend = 0.004).

This study describes differences in barriers to follow-up care between African American and White breast cancer survivors. METHODS: We conducted a mailed survey of women treated for non-metastatic breast cancer in 2009-2011, 6-24 months post-treatment (N = 203). Survivors were asked about 14 potential barriers to follow-up care. We used logistic regression to explore associations between barriers and race, adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: Our participants included 31 African American and 160 White survivors. At least one barrier to follow-up care was reported by 62 %. Compared to White survivors, African Americans were more likely to identify barriers related to out-of-pocket costs (28 vs. 51.6 %, p = 0.01), other health care costs (21.3 vs. 45.2 %, p = 0.01), anxiety/worry (29.4 vs. 51.6 %, p = 0.02), and transportation (4.4 vs. 16.1 %, p = 0.03). After adjustment for covariates, African Americans were three times as likely to report at least one barrier to care (odds ratio (OR) = 3.3, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1.1-10.1). CONCLUSIONS: Barriers to care are common among breast cancer survivors, especially African American women. Financial barriers to care may prevent minority and underserved survivors from accessing follow-up care. Enhancing insurance coverage or addressing out-of-pocket costs may help address financial barriers to follow-up care among breast cancer survivors. Psychosocial care aimed at reducing fear of recurrence may also be important to improve access among African American breast cancer survivors.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Breast,Healthcare Delivery Research Program,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25821145,0,1,0,1

Current histologic criteria are quite subjective and the clinical behavior of BE is highly variable and difficult to predict using these standards. It is widely believed that molecular alterations present in BE and EAC will provide more precise prognostic and predictive markers for these conditions than the current clinical and histologic features in use. In order to further define molecular alterations that can classify unique groups of BE and EAC, we utilized methylation microarrays to compare the global gene methylation status of a collection of normal squamous, BE, BE + high-grade dysplasia (HGD), and EAC cases. We found distinct global methylation signatures, as well as differential methylation of specific genes, that discriminated these histological groups. We also noted high and low methylation epigenotypes among the BE and EAC cases.

To the extent that reduced smoking reinforcement is one such mechanism, a longer duration of pre quit bupropion treatment should promote extinction of smoking behavior. We evaluated whether 4 weeks of pre quit bupropion (extended run-in) results in greater pre quit reductions in smoking rate and cotinine and, secondarily, greater short-term abstinence, than standard 1 week of pre quit bupropion (standard run-in). METHODS: Adult smokers (n = 95; 48 females) were randomized to a standard run-in group (n = 48; 3-week placebo, then 1-week bupropion pre quit) or an extended run-in group (4-week pre quit bupropion; n = 47). Both groups received group behavioral counseling and 7 weeks of post quit bupropion. Smoking rate (and craving, withdrawal, and subjective effects) was collected daily during the pre quit period; biochemical data (cotinine and carbon monoxide) were collected at study visits. RESULTS: During the pre quit period, the extended run-in group exhibited a greater decrease in smoking rate, compared to the standard run-in group, interaction p = .03. Cigarette craving and salivary cotinine followed a similar pattern, though the latter was evident only among women. Biochemically verified 4-week continuous abstinence rates were higher in the extended run-in group (53%) than the standard run-in group (31%), p = .033. CONCLUSIONS: The extended use of bupropion prior to a quit attempt reduces smoking behavior during the pre quit period and improved short-term abstinence rates. The data are consistent with an extinction-of-reinforcement model and support further investigation of extended run-in bupropion therapy for smoking cessation.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=25589680,0,1,0,0

The influence of community radiologists' medical malpractice perceptions and experience on screening mammography,"PURPOSE: To assess the relationship between radiologists' perception of and experience with medical malpractice and their patient-recall rates in actual community-based clinical settings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All study activities were approved by the institutional review boards of the involved institutions, and patient and radiologist informed consent was obtained where necessary. This study was performed in three regions of the United States (Washington, Colorado, and New Hampshire). Radiologists who routinely interpret mammograms completed a mailed survey that included questions on demographic data, practice environment, and medical malpractice. Survey responses were linked to interpretive performance for all screening mammography examinations performed between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2001. The odds of recall were modeled by using logistic regression analysis based on generalized estimating equations that adjust for study region. RESULTS: Of 181 eligible radiologists, 139 (76.8%) returned the survey with full consent. The analysis included 124 radiologists who had interpreted a total of 557 143 screening mammograms. Approximately half (64 of 122 [52.4%]) of the radiologists reported a prior malpractice claim, with 18 (14.8%) reporting mammography-related claims. The majority (n = 51 [81.0%]) of the 63 radiologists who responded to a question regarding the degree of stress caused by a medical malpractice claim described the experience as very or extremely stressful. More than three of every four radiologists (ie, 94 [76.4%] of 123) expressed concern about the impact medical malpractice has on mammography practice, with over half (72 [58.5%] of 123) indicating that their concern moderately to greatly increased the number of their recommendations for breast biopsies. Radiologists' estimates of their future malpractice risk were substantially higher than the actual historical risk. Almost one of every three radiologists (43 of 122 [35.3%]) had considered withdrawing from mammogram interpretation because of malpractice concerns. No significant association was found between recall rates and radiologists' experiences or perceptions of medical malpractice. CONCLUSION: U.S. radiologists are extremely concerned about medical malpractice and report that this concern affects their recall rates and biopsy recommendations. However, medical malpractice experience and concerns were not associated with recall or false-positive rates.

OBJECTIVE: To determine reasons for disparities in breast cancer outcomes across racial and ethnic groups. DESIGN: Prospective cohort. SETTING: The authors pooled data from 7 mammography registries that participate in the National Cancer Institute-funded Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. Cancer diagnoses were ascertained through linkage with pathology databases; Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results programs; and state tumor registries. PARTICIPANTS: 1,010,515 women 40 years of age and older who had at least 1 mammogram between 1996 and 2002; 17,558 of these women had diagnosed breast cancer. MEASUREMENTS: Patterns of mammography and the probability of inadequate mammography screening were examined. The authors evaluated whether overall and advanced cancer rates were similar across racial and ethnic groups and whether these rates were affected by the use of mammography. RESULTS: African-American, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American women were more likely than white women to have received inadequate mammographic screening (relative risk, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.2 to 1.2], 1.3 [CI, 1.2 to 1.3], 1.4 [CI, 1.3 to 1.4], and 1.2 [CI, 1.1 to 1.2] respectively). African-American women were more likely than white, Asian, and Native American women to have large, advanced-stage, high-grade, and lymph node-positive tumors of the breast. The observed differences in advanced cancer rates between African American and white women were attenuated or eliminated after the cohort was stratified by screening history. Among women who were previously screened at intervals of 4 to 41 months, African-American women were no more likely to have large, advanced-stage tumors or lymph node involvement than white women with the same screening history. African-American women had higher rates of high-grade tumors than white women regardless of screening history. The lower rates of advanced cancer among Asian and Native American women persisted when the cohort was stratified by mammography history. LIMITATIONS: Results are based on a cohort of women who had received mammographic evaluations. CONCLUSIONS: African-American women are less likely to receive adequate mammographic screening than white women, which may explain the higher prevalence of advanced breast tumors among African-American women. Tumor characteristics may also contribute to differences in cancer outcomes because African-American women have higher-grade tumors than white women regardless of screening.

Women at elevated risk may be interested in less aggressive approaches to risk reduction. For example, exercise might reduce estrogen, yet has fewer serious side effects and less negative impact than surgery or hormonal medications. Randomized controlled trial. Increased risk defined by risk prediction models or BRCA mutation status. Eligibility: Age 18-50, eumenorrheic, non-smokers, and body mass index (BMI) between 21 and 50 kg/m(2). 139 were randomized. Treadmill exercise: 150 or 300 min/week, five menstrual cycles. Control group maintained exercise <75 min/week. PRIMARY OUTCOME: Area under curve (AUC) for urinary estrogen. Secondary measures: urinary progesterone, quantitative digitized breast dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging background parenchymal enhancement. Mean age 34 years, mean BMI 26.8 kg/m(2). A linear dose-response relationship was observed such that every 100 min of exercise is associated with 3.6 % lower follicular phase estrogen AUC (linear trend test, p = 0.03). No changes in luteal phase estrogen or progesterone levels. There was also a dose-response effect noted: for every 100 min of exercise, there was a 9.7 % decrease in background parenchymal enhancement as measured by imaging (linear trend test, p = 0.009). Linear dose-response effect observed to reduce follicular phase estrogen exposure measured via urine and hormone sensitive breast tissue as measured by imaging. Future research should explore maintenance of effects and extent to which findings are repeatable in lower risk women. Given the high benefit to risk ratio, clinicians can inform young women at increased risk that exercise may blunt estrogen exposure while considering whether to try other preventive therapies.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Breast,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26510851,1,1,0,0

On the basis of their unique antiangiogenic effects, we tested the efficacy of nab-paclitaxel, which stimulates thrombospondin-1, and topotecan, which inhibits hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha, at metronomic dosing for the treatment of ovarian carcinoma. In vitro and in vivo SKOV3ip1, HeyA8, and HeyA8-MDR (taxane-resistant) orthotopic models were used to examine the effects of metronomic nab-paclitaxel and metronomic topotecan. We examined cell proliferation (Ki-67), apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3), and angiogenesis (microvessel density, MVD) in tumors obtained at necropsy. In vivo therapy experiments demonstrated treatment with metronomic nab-paclitaxel alone and in combination with metronomic topotecan resulted in significant reductions in tumor weight (62% in the SKOV3ip1 model, P < 0.01 and 96% in the HeyA8 model, P < 0.03) compared with vehicle (P < 0.01). In the HeyA8-MDR model, metronomic monotherapy with either cytotoxic agent had modest effects on tumor growth, but combination therapy decreased tumor burden by 61% compared with vehicle (P < 0.03). The greatest reduction in MVD (P < 0.05) and proliferation was seen in combination metronomic therapy groups. Combination metronomic therapy resulted in prolonged overall survival in vivo compared with other groups (P < 0.001). Tube formation was significantly inhibited in RF-24 endothelial cells exposed to media conditioned with metronomic nab-paclitaxel alone and media conditioned with combination metronomic nab-paclitaxel and metronomic topotecan. The combination of metronomic nab-paclitaxel and metronomic topotecan offers a novel, highly effective therapeutic approach for ovarian carcinoma that merits further clinical development.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Ovary, Female Genital Organs",Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26516159,0,1,0,0

There is a growing evidence that certain infectious agents acquired in early life can give rise to cancer development, but estimates of the cancer burden from this early-life acquisition is unknown. In this article, we have selected five cancers (cervical, liver, Burkitt's lymphoma-leukemia, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma) and examine their links to infectious agents (HPV, HBV, HCV, EBV, and HTLV-1) acquired in early life. For these agents, the acquisition in early life is from mother-to-child transmission, perinatal contact (with genital tract secretions, amniotic fluids, blood, and breast milk), saliva, sexual intercourse, and blood transfusion. We also discuss prevention strategies, address future directions, and propose mechanisms of action after a long latency period from the time of acquisition of the infectious agent in early life to cancer development.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Liver, Cervix, Nasal Cavity, Leukemia, Lymphoma, Digestive Organs, Female Genital Organs, Head and Neck, Lymph/Blood",Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26377256,0,1,0,0

The current cross-sectional study uses data on e-cigarette use from the 2014 Texas Youth Tobacco Survey (TYTS), a representative statewide sample of Texas middle school and high school students. This study's aims are to determine the prevalence of e-cigarette use, including rates of concurrent use with other tobacco products among Texas youth and to describe the demographic and tobacco use differences between e-cigarette users and non-users. METHODS: Participants were 13,602 6th through 12th grade students in Texas. Descriptive statistics were generated to determine the prevalence of current and lifetime e-cigarette use and to determine the prevalence of demographic characteristics across e-cigarette usage groups. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine differences in demographic characteristics, cigarette use in the home, and tobacco use behaviors for e-cigarette users versus non-users. RESULTS: Almost one quarter of all middle and high school students reported lifetime e-cigarette use and 14.0% were past 30-day users of these products. Current e-cigarette users were more likely to be high school students, white and male than non-current users. Both current and lifetime e-cigarette users were also more likely than their peers to use other tobacco products, although 24.2% of current e-cigarette users had never smoked conventional cigarettes, and 7.3% had never used any other type of tobacco product besides an e-cigarette.

We test whether ever-use of e-cigarettes among early adopters was associated with: 1) increased cigarette smoking cessation; and 2) reduced cigarette consumption. METHODS: A representative cohort of U.S. smokers (N = 2454) from the 2010 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey (TUS-CPS) was re-interviewed 1 year later. Outcomes were smoking cessation for 30+ days and change in cigarette consumption at follow-up. E-cigarettes use was categorized as for cessation purposes or for another reason. Multivariate regression was used to adjust for demographics and baseline cigarette dependence level. RESULTS: In 2011, an estimated 12 % of adult U.S. smokers had ever used e-cigarettes, and 41 % of these reported use to help quit smoking. Smokers who had used e-cigarettes for cessation were less likely to be quit for 30+ days at follow-up, compared to never-users who tried to quit (11.1 % vs 21.6 %; ORadj = 0.44, 95 % CI = 0.2-0.8). Among heavier smokers at baseline (15+ cigarettes per day (CPD)), ever-use of e-cigarettes was not associated with change in smoking consumption. Lighter smokers (<15 CPD) who had ever used e-cigarettes for quitting had stable consumption, while increased consumption was observed among all other lighter smokers, although this difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Among early adopters, ever-use of first generation e-cigarettes to aid quitting cigarette smoking was not associated with improved cessation or with reduced consumption, even among heavier smokers.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27769302,0,0,0,0

The primary aims of this study were to compare expectancies of dual users to former smokers, and to examine the association between expectancies and intentions to quit or reduce 'vaping' among former smokers. DESIGN AND SETTING: A large cross-sectional online survey of e-cigarette users conducted in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: We surveyed current e-cigarette users (n = 1815), including both current cigarette smokers ('dual users', n = 381) and former smokers (n = 1434). We further subdivided former smokers into those with (n = 686) and without (n = 748) intentions to reduce or quit e-cigarette use. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcomes were self-reported past-month smoking status and, among former smokers, current intentions to reduce or quit e-cigarette use, both adjusted for potential confounders. E-cigarette expectancy items were derived primarily from a previously validated measure of smoking expectancies. FINDINGS: Dual users reported less positive expectancies than former smokers about e-cigarettes, rating e-cigarettes as more physically irritating (beta = 0.10, P < 0.001) and addictive (beta = 0.06, P = 0.016), as well as less satisfying (beta = -0.11, P < 0.001). Former smokers with intentions to quit e-cigarettes also rated e-cigarettes less positively than former smokers without intentions to quit e-cigarettes, rating them more likely to damage health (beta = 0.16, P < 0.001) and cause addiction (beta = 0.10, P < 0.001), but less likely to taste good (beta = -0.08, P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Positive e-cigarette expectancies among e-cigarette users are associated with a greater likelihood of having quit smoking, but lower likelihood of intention to quit e-cigarette use.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26173651,0,0,0,0

Utilizing 2 analytic methods, this study illustrates challenges common in analyses of observational data, highlights measurement challenges, and reports associations between e-cigarette use and smoking cessation. METHODS: Data were drawn from an ongoing web-based smoking cessation trial. The sample was comprised of 2,123 participants with complete 3-month follow-up data. Logistic regression models with and without entropy balancing to control for confounds were conducted to evaluate the association between e-cigarette use and 30-day cigarette smoking abstinence. RESULTS: At follow-up, 31.7% of participants reported using e-cigarettes to quit in the past 3 months. E-cigarette users differed from nonusers on baseline characteristics including cigarettes per day, Fagerstrom score, quit attempt in the past year, and previous use of e-cigarettes to quit. At follow-up, e-cigarette users made more quit attempts and employed more cessation aids than smokers who did not use e-cigarettes to quit. E-cigarette use was negatively associated with abstinence after adjustment for baseline characteristics; however, the association was not significant after additional adjustment for use of other cessation aids at 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: The magnitude and significance of the estimated association between e-cigarette use and cessation in this study were dependent upon the analytical approach. Observational studies should employ multiple analytic approaches to address threats to validity. Future research should employ better measures of patterns of and reasons for e-cigarette use, frequency of e-cigarette use, and concurrent use of cessation aids.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=25542911,0,0,0,0

J Natl Cancer Inst 2015;107(11)",2015,Economic and survival implications of use of electric power morcellation for hysterectomy for presumed benign gynecologic disease,"BACKGROUND: Electric power morcellation during laparoscopic hysterectomy allows some women to undergo minimally invasive surgery but may disrupt underlying occult malignancies and increase the risk of tumor dissemination. METHODS: We developed a state transition Markov cohort simulation model of the risks and benefits of hysterectomy (abdominal, laparoscopic, and laparoscopic with electric power morcellation) for women with presumed benign gynecologic disease. The model considered perioperative morbidity, mortality, risk of cancer and dissemination, and outcomes in women with an underlying malignancy. We explored the effectiveness from a societal perspective stratified by age (<40, 40-49, 50-59, and >/=60 years). RESULTS: Under all scenarios, modeled laparoscopic hysterectomy without morcellation was the most beneficial strategy. Laparoscopic hysterectomy with morcellation was associated with 80.83 more intraoperative complications, 199.64 fewer perioperative complications, and 241.80 fewer readmissions than abdominal hysterectomy per 10 000 women. Per 10 000 women younger than age 40 years, laparoscopic hysterectomy with morcellation was associated with 1.57 more cases of disseminated cancer and 0.97 fewer deaths than abdominal hysterectomy. The excess cases of disseminated cancer per 10 000 women with morcellation compared with abdominal hysterectomy increased with age to 47.54 per 10 000 in women age 60 years and older. Compared with abdominal hysterectomy, this resulted in 0.30 (age 40-49 years), 5.07 (age 50-59 years), and 18.14 (age 60 years and older) excess deaths per 10 000 women in the respective age groups. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic hysterectomy without morcellation is the most beneficial approach of the three methods of hysterectomy studied. In older women, the risks of electric power morcellation may outweigh the benefits of minimally invasive hysterectomy.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Healthcare Delivery Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26449386,1,1,0,0

Hemoglobin is not stable in feces and can be affected by the heat. Effects of season and ambient temperature on fecal immunochemical tests (FITs) have demonstrated a decrease in positivity rates during the hottest season. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential effect of the average of 4-day ambient maximum temperature variations on the positivity of a single sample, one-time Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-waived FIT. SETTING: Midwestern tertiary care hospital. METHODS: Individuals scheduled for a colonoscopy were invited to complete a qualitative FIT prior to their colonoscopy in 2010 and 2011. FITs were read as positive or negative. RESULTS: Valid FITs were received from 1026 individuals over 25 months. The positivity rate was 10.9%. The mean 4-day average of daily maximum ambient temperatures was calculated including the day of receipt for each sample. Fahrenheit temperatures ranged from 16.0 to 96.8. Based on the odds ratio of 1.04 with a confidence interval of 0.94 to 1.14 for a 10 degrees F increase in temperature, there was no statistically significant evidence of an effect of the preceding maximum average 4-day ambient temperature on FIT positivity. CONCLUSION: No evidence was found that ambient temperature had an effect on positivity rate over a 25-month period using 4 different qualitative FIT products.

Benign breast biopsy can cause changes in the breast tissue, but whether such changes affect the interpretive performance of future screening mammography is not known. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated whether self-reported benign breast biopsy was associated with reduced subsequent screening mammography performance using examination data from the mammography registries of the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium from January 2, 1996, through December 31, 2005. A positive interpretation was defined as a recommendation for any additional evaluation. Cancer was defined as any invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ diagnosed within 1 year of mammography screening. Measures of mammography performance (sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value 1 [PPV1]) were compared both at woman level and breast level in the presence and absence of self-reported benign biopsy history. Referral to biopsy was considered a positive interpretation to calculate positive predictive value 2 (PPV2). Multivariable analysis of a correct interpretation on each performance measure was conducted after adjusting for registry, year of examination, patient characteristics, months since last mammogram, and availability of comparison film. Accuracy of the mammogram interpretation was measured using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: A total of 2,007,381 screening mammograms were identified among 799,613 women, of which 14.6% mammograms were associated with self-reported previous breast biopsy. Multivariable adjusted models for mammography performance showed reduced specificity (odds ratio [OR] = 0.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.73 to 0.75, P < .001), PPV2 (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.79 to 0.92, P < .001), and AUC (AUC 0.892 vs 0.925, P < .001) among women with self-reported benign biopsy.

The primary aim of this study was to determine whether following 7 months of smoking very low nicotine content cigarettes (VLNC), and then returning to their own cigarettes, smokers would demonstrate persistently reduced nicotine intake compared with baseline or quit smoking. METHODS: In a community-based clinic 135 smokers not interested in quitting were randomized to one of two groups. A research group smoked their usual brand of cigarettes, followed by five types of research cigarettes with progressively lower nicotine content, each for 1 month, followed by 6 months at the lowest nicotine level (0.5 mg/cigarette) (53 subjects) and then 12 months with no intervention (30 subjects completed). A control group smoked their usual brand for the same period of time (50 subjects at 6 months, 38 completed). Smoking behavior, biomarkers of nicotine intake and smoke toxicant exposure were measured. RESULTS: After 7 months smoking VLNC, nicotine intake remained below baseline (plasma cotinine 149 versus 250 ng/ml, P<0.005) with no significant change in cigarettes per day or expired carbon monoxide (CO). During the 12-month follow-up, cotinine levels in RNC smokers rose to baseline levels and to those of control smokers. Quit rates among RNC smokers were very low [7.5 versus 2% in controls, not significant). CONCLUSIONS: In smokers not interested in quitting, reducing the nicotine content in cigarettes over 12 months does not appear to result in extinction of nicotine dependence, assessed by persistently reduced nicotine intake or quitting smoking over the subsequent 12 months.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26198394,0,1,0,0

All seven groups used the same sources to obtain data on the use of screening mammography, adjuvant treatment, and benefits of treatment with respect to the rate of death from breast cancer. RESULTS: The proportion of the total reduction in the rate of death from breast cancer attributed to screening varied in the seven models from 28 to 65 percent (median, 46 percent), with adjuvant treatment contributing the rest. The variability across models in the absolute contribution of screening was larger than it was for treatment, reflecting the greater uncertainty associated with estimating the benefit of screening.

METHODS: We investigated the association between CAD use during film-screen screening mammography and specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value, cancer detection rates, and prognostic characteristics of breast cancers (stage, size, and node involvement). Records from 684 956 women who received more than 1.6 million film-screen mammograms at Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium facilities in seven states in the United States from 1998 to 2006 were analyzed. We used random-effects logistic regression to estimate associations between CAD and specificity (true-negative examinations among women without breast cancer), sensitivity (true-positive examinations among women with breast cancer diagnosed within 1 year of mammography), and positive predictive value (breast cancer diagnosed after positive mammograms) while adjusting for mammography registry, patient age, time since previous mammography, breast density, use of hormone replacement therapy, and year of examination (1998-2002 vs 2003-2006). All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Of 90 total facilities, 25 (27.8%) adopted CAD and used it for an average of 27.5 study months. In adjusted analyses, CAD use was associated with statistically significantly lower specificity (OR = 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.85 to 0.89, P < .001) and positive predictive value (OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.80 to 0.99, P = .03). A non-statistically significant increase in overall sensitivity with CAD (OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 0.84 to 1.33, P = .62) was attributed to increased sensitivity for ductal carcinoma in situ (OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 0.83 to 2.91; P = .17), although sensitivity for invasive cancer was similar with or without CAD (OR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.75 to 1.24; P = .77).

The purpose of this study was to investigate (1) whether participating in a lifestyle intervention is a feasible way to decrease binge eating symptoms (BES) and (2) whether changes in BES differed by intervention (physical activity vs. dietary habits) and binge eating status at baseline (binger eater vs. non-binge eater) in African American and Hispanic women. METHOD: Health Is Power (HIP) was a longitudinal randomized controlled trial to promote physical activity and improve dietary habits. Women (N = 180) who completed anthropometric measures and questionnaires assessing fruit and vegetable and dietary fat intake, BES and demographics at baseline and post-intervention six months later were included in the current study. RESULTS: Over one-fourth (27.8%) of participants were categorized as binge-eaters. Repeated measures ANOVA demonstrated significant two- and three-way interactions. Decreases in BES over time were greater in binge eaters than in non-binge eaters (F(1,164) = 33.253, p < .001), and women classified as binge eaters who participated in the physical activity intervention reported greater decreases in BES than non-binge eaters in the dietary habits intervention (F(1,157) = 5.170, p = .024). DISCUSSION: Findings suggest behavioral interventions to increase physical activity may lead to reductions in BES among ethnic minority women and ultimately reduce the prevalence of binge eating disorder and health disparities in this population.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26188275,1,0,1,0

To test the efficacy of a Web-based intervention designed to help women make better breast health choices, we adapted our previously tested, successful breast health intervention package to be delivered on the Internet, and then we tested it in a randomized trial. We recruited women from the general public to be randomized to either an active intervention group or a delayed intervention control group. The intervention consisted of a specialized Web site providing tailored and personalized risk information to all participants, followed by offers of additional support if needed. Follow-up at 1-year post-randomization revealed significant improvements in mammography screening in intervention women compared with control women (improvement of 13 percentage points). The intervention effects were more powerful in women who increased breast health knowledge and decreased cancer worry during intervention.

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) was recently made widely available to HIV-infected children in Zambia. However, the impact of early ART on KSHV transmission to HIV-infected children is unknown. METHODS: We enrolled and followed a cohort of 287 HIV-exposed, KSHV-negative children under 12 months of age from Lusaka, Zambia, to identify KSHV seroconversion events. Potential factors associated with KSHV infection-with an emphasis on HIV, ART, and immunological measures-were assessed through structured questionnaires and blood analyses. Incidence rate, Kaplan-Meier, and multivariable Cox regression models were used to assess differences in time to event (KSHV seroconversion) between groups. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: During follow-up, 151 (52.6%) children underwent KSHV seroconversion. Based on 3552 months of follow-up, we observed similar KSHV incidence rates between HIV-infected and uninfected children. Among HIV-infected children, ART-naive children had statistically significantly increased risk of KSHV acquisition (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] = 5.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.36 to 10.80, P < .001). Time-updated CD4(+) T-cell percentage was also statistically significantly associated with risk of KSHV acquisition (AHR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.74 to 0.92, P < .001), such that each 5% increase of CD4(+) T-cells represented an 18% decrease in risk of acquiring KSHV. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that early ART and prevention of immune suppression reduce the risk of KSHV acquisition among HIV-infected children in an area where both viruses are highly endemic. This study highlights the importance of programs in Africa to provide children with ART immediately after HIV infection is diagnosed.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26185193,1,1,0,0

In a recently completed randomized trial, primary care patients received GERA feedback based on a blood test for genetic polymorphisms and serum folate level (GERA Group) versus usual care (Control Group). Subsequently, participants were offered CRC screening. Among participants who received GERA feedback, being at elevated risk was negatively associated with prospective CRC screening adherence. Secondary analyses of data from this study were performed to identify independent predictors of adherence among participants who received GERA feedback. We obtained baseline survey, follow-up survey, and endpoint medical records data on sociodemographic background, knowledge, psychosocial characteristics, risk status, and adherence for 285 GERA Group participants. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed to identify predictors of CRC screening adherence. Following a 6-month outcomes observation period, we also conducted two focus groups with GERA Group participants to assess their perceptions of GERA risk feedback and screening. Content analyses of focus group data were evaluated to gain insights into participant response to risk feedback. Overall, half of GERA Group participants adhered to screening within 6 months after randomization. Multivariable analyses showed a statistically significant interaction between race and GERA feedback status relative to screening adherence (p = 0.043). Among participants who received average risk feedback, adherence was comparable among whites (49.7 %) and nonwhites (54.1 %); however, among those at elevated risk, adherence was substantially higher among whites (66.7 %) compared to nonwhites (33.3 %). Focus group findings suggest that whites were more likely than nonwhites to view elevated risk feedback as a prompt to screen. In response to receiving elevated risk feedback, nonwhites were more likely than whites to report feeling anxiety about the likelihood of being diagnosed with CRC. Further research is needed to explore race-related CRC screening differences in response to GERA feedback.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Colorectal, Digestive Organs",Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=25783675,0,1,0,1

OBJECTIVE: We tested whether interrupting sitting with short, moderate-intensity walking bouts improved glucose tolerance in children. DESIGN: Participants underwent two experimental conditions in random order on different days: continuous sitting for 3 hours or sitting interrupted by walking (3 min of moderate-intensity walking every 30 min). Insulin, C-peptide, glucose, and free fatty acids were measured every 30 minutes for 3 hours during an oral glucose tolerance test. Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated from hormone and substrate measurements. Children were given a buffet meal after each condition. SETTING: The study was conducted at the National Institutes of Health Hatfield Clinical Research Center. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-eight normal-weight 7-11 year olds participated. MAIN OUTCOMES: Patterns of substrate/hormone secretion and AUC, as well as energy intake, were examined by experimental condition. RESULTS: Interrupting sitting resulted in a 32% lower insulin AUC (P < .001), 17% lower C-peptide AUC (P < .001), and 7% lower glucose AUC (P = .018) vs continuous sitting. Mixed model results indicated that insulin (P = .036) and free fatty acid concentrations (P = .009) were significantly lower in the interrupted vs the continuous sitting condition. Lunchtime buffet meal energy intake did not significantly differ between the conditions (975 +/- 387 vs 963 +/- 309 kcal; P = .85). CONCLUSIONS: Interrupting sedentary time with brief moderate-intensity walking improved short-term metabolic function in non-overweight children without increasing subsequent energy intake.

Therefore, we aimed to assess the association between ENDS exposure, acceptance of cigarette smoking, and susceptibility to cigarette smoking. METHODS: Data from the 2014 Florida Youth Tobacco Survey with a state representative sample of middle and high school students (n = 68,928) were analyzed. Own ENDS use, exposure to ENDS advertising, living with ENDS users, acceptance of adult cigarette smoking, demographics, and known predictors of cigarette smoking were assessed. Susceptibility to cigarette smoking was assessed among never smokers. Weighted multiple logistic regression models and mediation analyses were conducted, stratified by middle/high school and never/ever smoking. Analyses were conducted in 2016. RESULTS: Own ENDS use, exposure to ENDS advertising, and living with ENDS users were associated with acceptance of adult cigarette smoking even among never smokers, after accounting for covariates (p < .05). In a mediation analysis, own ENDS use, exposure to ENDS advertising, and living with ENDS users were indirectly associated with susceptibility to cigarette smoking among never smokers through acceptance of adult cigarette smoking (p < .05).

Systemic C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) are measures of low-grade chronic inflammation and potential predictors of cancer survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS We evaluated the relationship between circulating markers of inflammation and breast cancer survival using data from the Health, Eating, Activity, and Lifestyle (HEAL) Study (a multiethnic prospective cohort study of women diagnosed with stage 0 to IIIA breast cancer). Circulating concentrations of CRP and SAA were measured approximately 31 months after diagnosis and tested for associations with disease-free survival (approximately 4.1 years of follow-up) and overall survival (approximately 6.9 years of follow-up) in 734 disease-free breast cancer survivors. Cox proportional hazards models were used with adjustment for potential confounding factors to generate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs. Results Elevated SAA and CRP were associated with reduced overall survival, regardless of adjustment for age, tumor stage, race, and body mass index (SAA P trend < .0001; CRP P trend = .002). The HRs for SAA and CRP tertiles suggested a threshold effect on survival, rather than a dose-response relationship (highest v lowest tertile: SAA HR = 3.15; 95% CI, 1.73 to 5.65; CRP HR = 2.27; 95% CI, 1.27 to 4.08). Associations were similar and still significant after adjusting for self-reported history of cardiovascular events and censoring cardiovascular disease deaths. Elevated CRP and SAA were also associated with reduced disease-free survival, although these associations were of borderline significance (SAA P trend = .04; CRP P trend = .07).

The probability of a cancer patient being employed dropped by almost 10 percentage points, and hours worked declined by up to 200 hours in the first year after diagnosis. Annual labor-market earnings dropped almost 40% within 2 years after diagnosis and remained low, whereas total family income declined by 20%, although it recovered within 4 years after the diagnosis. These economic impacts on survivors were driven by effects among men; the effects among women largely were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: A cancer diagnosis has substantial effects on the economic well-being of affected adults and their families. With the increasing number of cancer survivors in the US population, there is a growing need for examining the long-term implications for economic well-being and ways to mitigate the economic hardship associated with cancer.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Healthcare Delivery Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26501494,1,1,0,1

RESULTS: Cholecystokinin (CCK) rs747455 and proopiomelanocortin (POMC) rs6713532 and rs7565877 (for low Indigenous American (IA) ancestry); CCK rs8192472 and neuropeptide Y (NYP) rs16141 and rs14129 (intermediate IA ancestry); and leptin receptor (LEPR) rs11585329 (high IA ancestry) were strongly associated with multiple indicators of body size. There were no significant associations with breast cancer risk between genes and SNPs overall. However, LEPR was significantly associated with breast cancer risk among women with low IA ancestry (PARTP=0.024); POMC was significantly associated with breast cancer risk among women with intermediate (PARTP=0.015) and high (PARTP=0.012) IA ancestry. The overall pathway was statistically significant for pre-menopausal women with low IA ancestry (PARTP=0.05), as was cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript protein (CARTPT) (PARTP=0.014) and ghrelin (GHRL) (PARTP=0.007).

Dietary change and/or increased physical activity are the most commonly recommended lifestyle-based strategies for preventing or reversing obesity. One of several physiological systems that may be enhanced by dietary change and exercise is the immune system. In this study, we examined the effects of energy restriction (ER; 30% reduction relative to control energy intake) and/or exercise (EX; voluntary wheel running) on systemic and mucosal immune function. Female C57BL/6 mice were randomized into 4 treatment conditions: 1) controls consumed ad libitum (AL); 2) AL with access to running wheels (AL + EX); 3) 30% ER; and 4) 30% ER with access to running wheels (ER + EX). Both ER and EX reduced spleen weight and the number of splenic T and B lymphocytes (P < 0.05). ER enhanced natural killer (NK) cell function, but reduced concanavalin A (Con A)-induced T-cell proliferation (P < 0.05). In contrast, EX enhanced Con A-induced proliferation and cytokine production from Peyer's patch cells (P < 0.05). These data suggest that ER and EX enhance some, but not all, components of the immune system and are likely working via different biological mechanisms to regulate NK and T-cell function","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,"Office of the Associate Director, Applied Research Program",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=18156413,0,1,0,0

We assessed simultaneously characteristics of patients and their physicians that may be independently associated with participation. METHODS: CanCORS, a National Cancer Institute (NCI) -funded population-based observational cohort study of newly diagnosed patients with lung and colorectal cancers, sampled patients across five geographic areas, five health care delivery systems, and 15 Veterans Administration hospitals. We linked patient survey and medical record data with physician survey data to examine correlates of trial enrollment. RESULTS: Among 9,901 patients, 5.3% enrolled onto trials.

A multivariate general linear model was designed, in which the statistical relation between blood serum concentrations of HCB, beta-HCH, p,p'-DDT, or p,p'-DDE at different ages (at birth, 6, 16, and 45 months) and the distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) was treated as multivariate outcome variables. Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners and OCPs were strongly correlated in serum of children from our cohort. To ascertain that the association between DPOAEs at a given frequency and concentration of a pesticide is not influenced by PCBs or other OCP also present in serum, we calculated benchmark concentrations (BMCs) relating DPOAEs to a serum pesticide alone and in presence of confounding PCB-153 or other OCPs. We found that BMCs relating DPOAEs to serum pesticides are not affected by confounders. DPOAE amplitudes were associated with serum OCPs at all investigated time intervals, however, in a positive way with prenatal exposure and in a negative way with all postnatal exposures. We observed tonotopicity in the association of pesticides with amplitude of DPOAEs as its strength was frequency dependent. We conclude that exposure to OCPs in infancy at environmental concentrations may be associated with hearing deficits.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=25989860,0,1,0,1

A lack of correlation between expression of the canonical EpoR and rhEpo's effects on cancer cells prompted us to consider the existence of an alternative Epo receptor. Here, we identified EphB4 as an Epo receptor that triggers downstream signaling via STAT3 and promotes rhEpo-induced tumor growth and progression. In human ovarian and breast cancer samples, expression of EphB4 rather than the canonical EpoR correlated with decreased disease-specific survival in rhEpo-treated patients. These results identify EphB4 as a critical mediator of erythropoietin-induced tumor progression and further provide clinically significant dimension to the biology of erythropoietin.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Ovary, Breast, Female Genital Organs",Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26481148,0,1,0,0

Atypical hyperplasia substantially increases breast cancer risk, but identification of biomarkers to further improve risk stratification is needed. We evaluated ERbeta expression in breast tissues from women with atypical hyperplasia and association with subsequent breast cancer risk. ERbeta expression was examined by immunohistochemistry in a well-characterized 171-women cohort with atypical hyperplasia diagnosed 1967-1991. Nuclear ERbeta percent and intensity was scored in the atypia and adjacent normal lobules. An ERbeta sum score (percent + intensity) was calculated and grouped as low, moderate, or high. Competing risks regression was used to assess associations of ERbeta expression with breast cancer risk. After 15-year median follow-up, 36 women developed breast cancer. ERbeta expression was lower in atypia lobules in than normal lobules, by percent staining and intensity (both P < 0.001). Higher ERbeta expression in the atypia or normal lobules, evaluated by percent staining, intensity or sum score, decreased the risk of subsequent breast cancer by 2-fold (P = 0.04) and 2.5-fold (P = 0.006). High normal lobule ERbeta expression conferred the strongest protective effect in premenopausal women: the 20-year cumulative incidence of breast cancer was 0% for women younger than 45 years with high versus 31% for low-moderate ERbeta expression (P = 0.0008). High ERbeta expression was associated with a significantly decreased risk of breast cancer in women with atypical hyperplasia. These data suggest that ERbeta may be a useful biomarker for risk stratification and a novel therapeutic target for breast cancer risk reduction.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Breast,Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26276747,1,1,0,1

METHODS: Linking was accomplished using both equipercentile and item response theory (IRT) methods. Item parameters for legacy items were estimated on the PROMIS-PI metric to allow for pattern scoring. Crosswalk tables also were developed that associated raw scores (summed or average) on legacy measures to PROMIS-PI scores. For each linking strategy, participants' actual PROMIS-PI scores were compared to those predicted based on their legacy scores. To assess the impact of different sample sizes, we conducted random resampling with replacement across 10,000 replications with sample sizes of n = 25, 50, and 75. RESULTS: Analyses supported the assumption that all three scales were measuring similar constructs. IRT methods produced marginally better results than equipercentile linking. Accuracy of the links was substantially affected by sample size. CONCLUSIONS: The linking tools (crosswalks and item parameter estimates) developed in this study are robust methods for estimating the PROMIS-PI scores of samples based on legacy measures.

The goal of the current analyses was to determine whether the SenseWear((R)) Pro3 Armband (armband), typically used to assess physical activity, is reliable at assessing sleep parameters. The armband was compared with the AMI Motionlogger((R)) (actigraph), a validated activity monitor for sleep assessment, and with polysomnography, the gold standard for assessing sleep. Participants were 20 adolescents (mean age = 15.5 years) with a mean body mass index percentile of 63.7. All participants wore the armband and actigraph on their non-dominant arm while in-lab during a nocturnal polysomnographic recording (600 min). Epoch-by-epoch sleep/wake data and concordance of sleep parameters were examined. No significant sleep parameter differences were found between the armband and polysomnography; the actigraph tended to overestimate sleep and underestimate wake compared with polysomnography. Both devices showed high sleep sensitivity, but lower wake detection rates. Bland-Altman plots showed large individual differences in armband sleep parameter concordance rates. The armband did well estimating sleep overall, with group results more similar to polysomnography than the actigraph; however, the armband was less accurate at an individual level than the actigraph.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26126746,0,1,1,0

Stat Biosci 2015;7(2):187-205",2015,Estimation after a group sequential trial,"Group sequential trials are one important instance of studies for which the sample size is not fixed a priori but rather takes one of a finite set of pre-specified values, dependent on the observed data. Much work has been devoted to the inferential consequences of this design feature. Molenberghs et al (2012) and Milanzi et al (2012) reviewed and extended the existing literature, focusing on a collection of seemingly disparate, but related, settings, namely completely random sample sizes, group sequential studies with deterministic and random stopping rules, incomplete data, and random cluster sizes. They showed that the ordinary sample average is a viable option for estimation following a group sequential trial, for a wide class of stopping rules and for random outcomes with a distribution in the exponential family. Their results are somewhat surprising in the sense that the sample average is not optimal, and further, there does not exist an optimal, or even, unbiased linear estimator. However, the sample average is asymptotically unbiased, both conditionally upon the observed sample size as well as marginalized over it. By exploiting ignorability they showed that the sample average is the conventional maximum likelihood estimator. They also showed that a conditional maximum likelihood estimator is finite sample unbiased, but is less efficient than the sample average and has the larger mean squared error. Asymptotically, the sample average and the conditional maximum likelihood estimator are equivalent. This previous work is restricted, however, to the situation in which the the random sample size can take only two values, N = n or N = 2n. In this paper, we consider the more practically useful setting of sample sizes in a the finite set {n 1, n 2, ..., nL }. It is shown that the sample average is then a justifiable estimator , in the sense that it follows from joint likelihood estimation, and it is consistent and asymptotically unbiased. We also show why simulations can give the false impression of bias in the sample average when considered conditional upon the sample size. The consequence is that no corrections need to be made to estimators following sequential trials. When small-sample bias is of concern, the conditional likelihood estimator provides a relatively straightforward modification to the sample average. Finally, it is shown that classical likelihood-based standard errors and confidence intervals can be applied, obviating the need for technical corrections.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26478751,0,0,0,0

OBJECTIVE: To inform the USPSTF by modeling the benefits, burden, and harms of CRC screening strategies; estimating the optimal ages to begin and end screening; and identifying a set of model-recommendable strategies that provide similar life-years gained (LYG) and a comparable balance between LYG and screening burden. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Comparative modeling with 3 microsimulation models of a hypothetical cohort of previously unscreened US 40-year-olds with no prior CRC diagnosis. EXPOSURES: Screening with sensitive guaiac-based fecal occult blood testing, fecal immunochemical testing (FIT), multitarget stool DNA testing, flexible sigmoidoscopy with or without stool testing, computed tomographic colonography (CTC), or colonoscopy starting at age 45, 50, or 55 years and ending at age 75, 80, or 85 years. Screening intervals varied by modality. Full adherence for all strategies was assumed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Life-years gained compared with no screening (benefit), lifetime number of colonoscopies required (burden), lifetime number of colonoscopy complications (harms), and ratios of incremental burden and benefit (efficiency ratios) per 1000 40-year-olds. RESULTS: The screening strategies provided LYG in the range of 152 to 313 per 1000 40-year-olds. Lifetime colonoscopy burden per 1000 persons ranged from fewer than 900 (FIT every 3 years from ages 55-75 years) to more than 7500 (colonoscopy screening every 5 years from ages 45-85 years). Harm from screening was at most 23 complications per 1000 persons screened. Strategies with screening beginning at age 50 years generally provided more LYG as well as more additional LYG per additional colonoscopy than strategies with screening beginning at age 55 years. There were limited empirical data to support a start age of 45 years. For persons adequately screened up to age 75 years, additional screening yielded small increases in LYG relative to the increase in colonoscopy burden. With screening from ages 50 to 75 years, 4 strategies yielded a comparable balance of screening burden and similar LYG (median LYG per 1000 across the models): colonoscopy every 10 years (270 LYG); sigmoidoscopy every 10 years with annual FIT (256 LYG); CTC every 5 years (248 LYG); and annual FIT (244 LYG). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this microsimulation modeling study of a previously unscreened population undergoing CRC screening that assumed 100% adherence, the strategies of colonoscopy every 10 years, annual FIT, sigmoidoscopy every 10 years with annual FIT, and CTC every 5 years performed from ages 50 through 75 years provided similar LYG and a comparable balance of benefit and screening burden.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Colorectal,Surveillance Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27305518,0,1,0,1

Prior research has implicated adrenergic signaling in tumor growth and metastasis. Given that adrenergic signaling is influenced by both positive and negative factors, the authors examined how 2 different aspects of well-being (eudaimonic and positive affect) and psychological distress were associated with tumor norepinephrine (NE) in patients with ovarian cancer. METHODS: A total of 365 women with suspected ovarian cancer completed psychosocial assessments before surgery and clinical information was obtained from medical records. Study inclusion was confirmed after histological diagnosis. Tumor NE was measured in frozen tissue samples using high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to model eudaimonic well-being, positive affect, and psychological distress, and structural equation modeling was used to examine associations between these factors and tumor NE. RESULTS: Eudaimonic well-being, positive affect, and psychological distress, modeled as distinct but correlated constructs, best fit the data (ie, compared with unitary or 2-factor models) (root mean square error of approximation, 0.048; comparative fit index, 0.982; and standardized root-mean-squared residual, 0.035).

In contrast, no effects were found for positive affect or psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS: Eudaimonic well-being was found to be associated with lower tumor NE, independent of positive affect and psychological distress. Because adrenergic signaling is implicated in tumor progression, increasing eudaimonic well-being may improve both psychological and physiologic resilience in patients with ovarian cancer.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Ovary, Female Genital Organs",Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26096769,1,1,0,1

BMC Health Serv Res 2015;15(1):547",2015,Evaluating a train-the-trainer approach for improving capacity for evidence-based decision making in public health,"BACKGROUND: Evidence-based public health gives public health practitioners the tools they need to make choices based on the best and most current evidence. An evidence-based public health training course developed in 1997 by the Prevention Research Center in St. Louis has been taught by a transdisciplinary team multiple times with positive results. In order to scale up evidence-based practices, a train-the-trainer initiative was launched in 2010. METHODS: This study examines the outcomes achieved among participants of courses led by trained state-level faculty. Participants from trainee-led courses in four states (Indiana, Colorado, Nebraska, and Kansas) over three years were asked to complete an online survey. Attempts were made to contact 317 past participants. One-hundred forty-four (50.9 %) reachable participants were included in analysis. Outcomes measured include frequency of use of materials, resources, and other skills or tools from the course; reasons for not using the materials and resources; and benefits from attending the course. Survey responses were tabulated and compared using Chi-square tests. RESULTS: Among the most commonly reported benefits, 88 % of respondents agreed that they acquired knowledge about a new subject, 85 % saw applications for the knowledge to their work, and 78 % agreed the course also improved abilities to make scientifically informed decisions at work. The most commonly reported reasons for not using course content as much as intended included not having enough time to implement evidence-based approaches (42 %); other staff/peers lack training (34 %); and not enough funding for continued training (34 %). The study findings suggest that utilization of course materials and teachings remains relatively high across practitioner groups, whether they were taught by the original trainers or by state-based trainers. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that train-the-trainer is an effective method for broadly disseminating evidence-based public health principles. Train-the-trainer is less costly than the traditional method and allows for courses to be tailored to local issues, thus making it a viable approach to dissemination and scale up of new public health practices.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26652172,0,0,0,0

We estimated the odds of late-stage breast cancer among health-plan and surrounding community women because it was too early to compare changes in mortality. We also estimated the odds of late-stage disease (1995-1998) associated with program enrollment and mammography screening among health-plan women.

METHODS: We invited 7,167 men (mean age of 75 years) from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, a prospective cohort of male health professionals. We considered individual Cogstate scores and composite scores measuring psychomotor speed and attention, learning and working memory and overall cognition. Multivariate linear regression was used to assess the association between risk factors measured 4 and 28 years prior to cognitive testing and each outcome. RESULTS: The 1,866 men who agreed to complete Cogstate testing were similar to the 5,301 non-responders. Many expected risk factors were associated with Cogstate scores in multivariate adjusted models. Increasing age was significantly associated with worse performance on all outcomes (p < 0.001). For risk factors measured 4 years prior to testing and overall cognition, a history of hypertension was significantly associated with worse performance (mean difference of -0.08 standard units (95% CI -0.16, 0.00)) and higher consumption of nuts was significantly associated with better performance (>2 servings/week vs. <1 serving/month: 0.15 (0.03, 0.27)). CONCLUSIONS: The self-administered Cogstate battery showed significant associations with several risk factors known to be associated with cognitive function. Future studies of cognitive aging may benefit from the numerous advantages of self-administered computerized testing.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26501919,0,0,0,1

Identifying and monitoring process measures for screening is a focus of the National Cancer Institute's Population-based Research Optimizing Screening through Personalized Regimens (PROSPR) initiative, which requires participating centers to report structured data across the cancer screening continuum. We evaluate the accuracy of automated information extraction of imaging findings from radiology reports, which are available as unstructured text. We present prevalence estimates of imaging findings for breast imaging received by women who obtained care in a primary care network participating in PROSPR (n = 139,953 radiology reports) and compared automatically extracted data elements to a ""gold standard"" based on manual review for a validation sample of 941 randomly selected radiology reports, including mammograms, digital breast tomosynthesis, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The prevalence of imaging findings vary by data element and modality (e.g., suspicious calcification noted in 2.6% of screening mammograms, 12.1% of diagnostic mammograms, and 9.4% of tomosynthesis exams). In the validation sample, the accuracy of identifying imaging findings, including suspicious calcifications, masses, and architectural distortion (on mammogram and tomosynthesis); masses, cysts, non-mass enhancement, and enhancing foci (on MRI); and masses and cysts (on ultrasound), range from 0.8 to1.0 for recall, precision, and F-measure. Information extraction tools can be used for accurate documentation of imaging findings as structured data elements from text reports for a variety of breast imaging modalities. These data can be used to populate screening registries to help elucidate more effective breast cancer screening processes.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Breast,Healthcare Delivery Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=25561069,0,1,0,0

Comprehensive smoke-free policies are the only effective way to protect the population from the harms of SHS. China does not have a comprehensive national smoke-free law but some local-level regulations have been implemented. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate local level smoke-free regulations across 7 cities in China by measuring the prevalence of smoking in public places (workplaces, restaurants and bars), and support for smoke-free policies over time. METHODS: Data were from Waves 2 to 4 of the International Tobacco Control (ITC) China Survey (2007-2012), a face-to-face cohort survey of approximately 800 smokers in each of 7 cities in mainland China. Multivariate logistic regression models estimated with generalised estimating equations were used to test the changes in variables over time. RESULTS: As of 2012, over three-quarters of respondents were exposed to smoking in bars; more than two-thirds were exposed to smoking in restaurants and more than half were exposed to smoking in indoor workplaces. Small decreases in the prevalence of smoking were found overall from Waves 2 to 4 for indoor workplaces, restaurants and bars, although the decline was minimal for bars. Support for complete smoking bans increased over time for each venue, although it was lowest for bars. CONCLUSIONS: Existing partial smoking bans across China have had minimal impact on reducing smoking in public places. A strongly enforced, comprehensive national smoke-free law is urgently needed in order to achieve greater public health gains.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26407720,0,0,0,1

Because biomarkers available for calibration are limited, most investigators use self-reports (e.g., 24-hour recalls (24HRs)) as the reference instrument. We evaluated the performance of 24HRs as reference instruments for calibrating food frequency questionnaires (FFQs), using data from the Validation Studies Pooling Project, comprising 5 large validation studies using recovery biomarkers. Using 24HRs as reference instruments, we estimated attenuation factors, correlations with truth, and calibration equations for FFQ-reported intakes of energy and for protein, potassium, and sodium and their densities, and we compared them with values derived using biomarkers. Based on 24HRs, FFQ attenuation factors were substantially overestimated for energy and sodium intakes, less for protein and potassium, and minimally for nutrient densities. FFQ correlations with truth, based on 24HRs, were substantially overestimated for all dietary components. Calibration equations did not capture dependencies on body mass index. We also compared predicted bias in estimated relative risks adjusted using 24HRs as reference instruments with bias when making no adjustment. In disease models with energy and 1 or more nutrient intakes, predicted bias in estimated nutrient relative risks was reduced on average, but bias in the energy risk coefficient was unchanged.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28402488,0,1,0,1

Radiology 2007;243(3):681-689",2007,Evidence-based target recall rates for screening mammography,"PURPOSE: To retrospectively identify target recall rates for screening mammography on the basis of how sensitivity shifts with recall rate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study group included 1 872 687 subsequent and 171 104 first screening mammograms from 1996 to 2001 from 172 and 139 facilities, respectively, in six sites of the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. Institutional review board (IRB) approval was obtained from each site. Informed consent requirements of the IRBs were followed. The study was HIPAA compliant. Recall rate was defined as the percentage of screening studies for which further work-up was recommended by the radiologist. Sensitivity was defined as the proportion of cancers that were detected at screening mammography. Piecewise linear regression was used to model sensitivity as a function of recall rate. This model allows detection of critical recall rates in which significant changes (shifts) occurred in the rates that sensitivity increased with increasing recall rate. Rates were interpreted as number of additional work-ups per additional cancer detected (AW/ACD) or, in other words, the estimated number of additional women needed to be recalled at a given rate to detect one additional cancer. RESULTS: For first mammograms, a single shift in the estimated AW/ACD rate occurred at a recall rate of 10.0%, with the rate jumping dramatically from 35 to 172. For subsequent mammograms, four shifts were identified. At a recall rate of 6.7%, the estimated AW/ACD increased from 80 to 132, which rendered it the highest desirable target recall rate. At a recall rate of 12.3%, the estimated AW/ACD was 304, which suggests little benefit for any higher recall rate. CONCLUSION: Recall rates of 10.0% for first and 6.7% for subsequent mammograms are recommended targets on the basis of their AW/ACD rates (less than 100).

We found that the most reliable two factors within the five-factor solution were Cognitive Causation, tapping beliefs that risk thoughts may encourage cancer development, and Negative Affect in Risk, assessing negative feelings generated during the risk perception process. For these factors, there were high levels of item endorsement, especially in minority groups, and only modest associations with established cancer risk perception and worry assessments, indicating novel content.

Clin Cancer Res 2015;21(20):4709-4718",2015,Exome sequencing reveals AMER1 as a frequently mutated gene in colorectal cancer,"PURPOSE: Somatic mutations occur at early stages of adenoma and accumulate throughout colorectal cancer progression. The aim of this study was to characterize the mutational landscape of stage II tumors and to search for novel recurrent mutations likely implicated in colorectal cancer tumorigenesis. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The exomic DNA of 42 stage II, microsatellite-stable colon tumors and their paired mucosae were sequenced. Other molecular data available in the discovery dataset [gene expression, methylation, and copy number variations (CNV)] were used to further characterize these tumors. Additional datasets comprising 553 colorectal cancer samples were used to validate the discovered mutations. RESULTS: As a result, 4,886 somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNV) were found. Almost all SNVs were private changes, with few mutations shared by more than one tumor, thus revealing tumor-specific mutational landscapes. Nevertheless, these diverse mutations converged into common cellular pathways, such as cell cycle or apoptosis. Among this mutational heterogeneity, variants resulting in early stop codons in the AMER1 (also known as FAM123B or WTX) gene emerged as recurrent mutations in colorectal cancer. Losses of AMER1 by other mechanisms apart from mutations such as methylation and copy number aberrations were also found. Tumors lacking this tumor suppressor gene exhibited a mesenchymal phenotype characterized by inhibition of the canonical Wnt pathway. CONCLUSIONS: In silico and experimental validation in independent datasets confirmed the existence of functional mutations in AMER1 in approximately 10% of analyzed colorectal cancer tumors. Moreover, these tumors exhibited a characteristic phenotype.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Colorectal, Digestive Organs",Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26071483,0,1,0,1

This retrospective cohort study examines the degree to which health systems (e.g., physician, hospital) factors explain black-white disparities in colon cancer care. METHODS: Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program; Medicare claims; the American Medical Association Masterfile; and hospital surveys were linked to examine chemotherapy receipt after stage III colon cancer resection among 5294 elderly (> or = 66 years of age) black and white Medicare-insured patients. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with black-white differences in chemotherapy use. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Black and white patients were equally likely to consult with a medical oncologist, but among patients who had such a consultation, black patients were less likely than white patients (59.3% versus 70.4%, difference = 10.9%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.1% to 16.4%, P < .001) to receive chemotherapy. This black-white disparity was highest among patients aged 66-70 years (black patients 65.7%, white patients 86.3%, difference = 20.6%, 95% CI = 10.7% to 30.4%, P < .001) and decreased with age. The disparity among patients aged 66-70 years also remained statistically significant in the regression analysis. Overall, patient, physician, hospital, and environmental factors accounted for approximately 50% of the disparity in chemotherapy receipt among patients aged 66-70 years; surgical length of stay and neighborhood socioeconomic status accounted for approximately 27% of the disparity in this age group, and health systems factors accounted for 12%. CONCLUSIONS: Black and white Medicare-insured colon cancer patients have an equal opportunity to learn about adjuvant chemotherapy from a medical oncologist but do not receive chemotherapy equally.

This study examined several common metrics for expressing energy expenditure to determine whether one metric can be used for all healthy children. Such a metric could improve our ability to further advance the Compendium of Physical Activities for Youth. METHODS: A secondary analysis of oxygen uptake (VO2) data obtained from five sites was completed, that included 947 children ages 5 to 18 years, who engaged in 14 different activities. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) was computed based on Schofield Equations [Hum Nutr Clin Nut. 39(Suppl 1), 1985]. Absolute oxygen uptake (ml.min-1), oxygen uptake per kilogram body mass (VO2 in ml.kg-1.min-1), net oxygen uptake (VO2 - resting metabolic rate), allometric scaled oxygen uptake (VO2 in ml.kg-0.75.min-1) and YOUTH-MET (VO2.[resting VO2] -1) were calculated. These metrics were regressed with age, sex, height, and body mass. RESULTS: Net and allometric-scaled VO2, and YOUTH-MET were least associated with age, sex and physical characteristics. For moderate-to-vigorous intensity activities, allometric scaling was least related to age and sex. For sedentary and low-intensity activities, YOUTH-MET was least related to age and sex. CONCLUSIONS: No energy expenditure metric completely eliminated the influence of age, physical characteristics, and sex. The Adult MET consistently overestimated EE. YOUTH-MET was better for expressing energy expenditure for sedentary and light activities, whereas allometric scaling was better for moderate and vigorous intensity activities. From a practical perspective, The YOUTH-MET may be the more feasible metric for improving of the Compendium of Physical Activities for Youth.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Healthcare Delivery Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26102204,0,0,0,1

We sought to validate externally a previously published Medicare-claims-based algorithm for classifying surgical treatments among patients with early-stage kidney cancer. To achieve this aim, we compared procedure assignments based on Medicare claims with the type of surgery specified in SEER registry data and clinical operative reports. METHODS: Using linked SEER-Medicare data, we calculated the agreement between Medicare claims and SEER data for identification of cancer-directed surgery among 6,515 patients diagnosed with early-stage kidney cancer. Next, for a subset of 120 cases, we determined the agreement between the claims algorithm and the medical record. Finally, using the medical record as the reference-standard, we calculated the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the claims algorithm. RESULTS: Among 6,515 cases, Medicare claims and SEER data identified 5,483 (84.1%) and 5,774 (88.6%) patients, respectively, who underwent cancer-directed surgery (observed agreement = 93%, kappa = 0.69, 95% CI 0.66 - 0.71).

RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: We assessed percentage body fat, serum leptin levels, and bone mineral density in ovariectomized and non-ovariectomized C57BL/6 female mice that had been fed various calorically dense diets to induce body weight profiles ranging from lean to very obese. Additionally, we assessed percentage body fat and whole body bone mineral density in 37 overweight and extremely obese postmenopausal women from the Women's Contraceptive and Reproductive Experiences study. RESULTS: In mice, higher levels of body adiposity (>40% body fat) were associated with lower bone mineral density in ovariectomized C57BL/6 female mice. A similar trend was observed in a small sample of postmenopausal women. DISCUSSION: The complementary studies in mice and women suggest that extreme obesity in postmenopausal women may be associated with reduced bone mineral density. Thus, extreme obesity (BMI > 40 kg/m2) may increase the risk for osteopenia and osteoporosis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data source was 584,470 women with no previous breast cancer from six states in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. In this observational study, we linked data from 1,207,631 routine screening mammograms performed between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2002, to data on additional imaging, interventional procedures, and biopsy outcome (benign or malignant). Additional examinations were categorized into diagnostic mammography, sonography, or both. Events were further subdivided by whether they were performed on the same day as the screening examination and whether patients reported breast symptoms. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between additional evaluation performed and the likelihood of biopsy and the likelihood of subsequent breast cancer diagnosis after adjustment for patient and screening mammographic characteristics. RESULTS: Most (92%) of the screening examinations did not include additional imaging. The probability of biopsy ranged from 0.4% for examinations with no follow-up to 20.1% for those with diagnostic mammography and sonography on the same day as screening among women without symptoms and from 2.1% for those with no follow-up to 18.9% for those with diagnostic mammography and sonography on a day different from screening among women with symptoms. Thirty percent of women without symptoms who underwent biopsy had cancer, whereas 27.1% of women with symptoms who underwent biopsy had cancer. Women who underwent biopsy after screening mammography with diagnostic mammography and sonography on the same day had the highest probability of breast cancer (37.6% among women without symptoms, 36.4% among women with symptoms), whereas those who underwent only sonography performed at a later date had the lowest probability of breast cancer (11.9% among women without symptoms, 17.1% among women with symptoms). CONCLUSION: Women who undergo screening mammography followed by diagnostic mammography and sonography have a high probability of undergoing biopsy and having the biopsy result of breast cancer when follow-up imaging is performed on the same day as screening mammography whether or not breast symptoms are present.

METHODS: We studied 576 women (n = 73 aged 40-49 years and n = 503 aged 50 years or older) who were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between 1988 and 1993. Interval cancers were defined as those diagnosed within 12 or 24 months after a negative screening mammogram and before a subsequent mammogram. Tumor growth rate was assessed by mitotic figure count and Ki-67 positivity. The main outcome measures were percentage of women with interval cancer (1 -mammographic sensitivity) by age, odds ratio (OR) of interval cancer by age, and excess odds (i.e., the percentage of the odds ratio for age that was explained by individual covariates). RESULTS: Interval cancers occurred in 27.7% of younger women and 13.9% of older women within 12 months (OR = 2.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.14 to 4.77) and in 52.1% of younger women and 24.7% of older women within 24 months (OR = 3.58, 95% CI = 2.15 to 5.97). Greater breast density explained 67.6% of the decreased mammographic sensitivity in younger women at 12 months, whereas rapid tumor growth explained 30.6% and breast density explained 37.6% of the decreased sensitivity in younger women at 24 months. CONCLUSIONS: Breast density largely explained decreased mammographic sensitivity at 12 months, whereas rapid tumor growth contributed to decreased mammographic sensitivity at 24 months. A 12-month versus a 24-month mammography screening interval may therefore reduce the adverse impact of faster growing tumors on mammographic sensitivity in younger women","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Breast,"Office of the Associate Director, Applied Research Program",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=15467032,0,1,0,1

We synthesized 12 reviews of descriptive and intervention studies published between 1980 and 2008. There was wide variability in definition of follow-up, setting, study population, and reported prevalence rates. Correlates of follow-up included patient characteristics (eg, knowledge and age), social support, provider characteristics, practice (eg, having reminders systems), community and professional norms (eg, quality measures), and policy (eg, federal programs). Effective interventions included patient education and support; delivery systems design changes, such as navigation; and information system changes, most notably patient tracking and physician reminders. Few studies focused explicitly on interfaces and steps of care, such as communication between primary care and specialists, or simultaneously targeted the multilevel factors that affect care. Future practice and research priorities should include development of clear operational definitions of the steps and interfaces related to patients, providers, and organizations; reflect evolving guidelines and new technologies; determine priorities for intervention testing; and improve measures and apply appropriate study designs","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Colorectal, Cervix, Breast, Digestive Organs, Female Genital Organs","Health Services and Economics Branch, Applied Cancer Screening Research Branch, Office of the Associate Director, Behavioral Research Program, Applied Research Program",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=20386054,0,1,0,0

Latinas are more likely to report mammography intentions and use, if a family member or friend recommends that they get a mammogram. Little is known about the mechanisms underlying the relationship between social interactions and mammography intentions. Theory suggests that family/friend recommendations increase perceived mammography norms (others believe a woman should obtain a mammogram) and support (others will help her obtain a mammogram), which in turn increase mammography intentions and use. We tested these hypotheses with data from the inverted exclamation markFortaleza Latina! study, a randomized controlled trial including 539 Latinas in Washington State. Women whose family/friend recommended they get a mammogram within the last year were more likely to report mammography intentions, norms and support. Perceived mammography norms mediated the relationship between family/friend recommendations and intentions, Mediated Effect = 0.38, 95%CI [0.20, 0.61], but not support, Mediated Effect = 0.002, 95%CI [-0.07, 0.07].

Research in healthy populations has shown reduced inflammation with higher dietary intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which could potentially reduce fatigue. This study investigated fatigue, inflammation, and intake of omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs among breast cancer survivors. METHODS: Six hundred thirty-three survivors (mean age, 56 years; stage I to IIIA) participating in the Health, Eating, Activity, and Lifestyle Study completed a food frequency/dietary supplement questionnaire and provided a blood sample assayed for C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (30 months after diagnosis) and completed the Piper Fatigue Scale and Short Form-36 (SF-36) vitality scale (39 months after diagnosis). Analysis of covariance and logistic regression models tested relationships between inflammation and fatigue, inflammation and omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA intake, and PUFA intake and fatigue, controlling for three incremental levels of confounders. Fatigue was analyzed continuously (Piper scales) and dichotomously (SF-36 vitality </= 50). RESULTS: Behavioral (P = .003) and sensory (P = .001) fatigue scale scores were higher by increasing CRP tertile; relationships were attenuated after adjustment for medication use and comorbidity. Survivors with high CRP had 1.8 times greater odds of fatigue after full adjustment (P < .05). Higher intake of omega-6 relative to omega-3 PUFAs was associated with greater CRP (P = .01 after full adjustment) and greater odds of fatigue (odds ratio, 2.6 for the highest v lowest intake; P < .05).

However, results from a national survey of clinical practice in 1999-2000 indicated that many primary care physicians used inadequate methods to implement FOBT screening and follow-up. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether methods to screen for fecal occult blood have improved, including the use of newer more sensitive stool tests. DESIGN: Cross-sectional national survey of primary care physicians. PARTICIPANTS: Participants consisted of 1,134 primary care physicians who reported ordering or performing FOBT in the 2006-2007 National Survey of Primary Care Physicians' Recommendations and Practices for Cancer Screening. MAIN MEASURES: Self-reported data on details of FOBT implementation and follow-up of positive results. RESULTS: Most physicians report using standard guaiac tests; higher sensitivity guaiac tests and immunochemical tests were reported by only 22.0% and 8.9%, respectively. In-office testing, that is, testing of a single specimen collected during a digital rectal examination in the office, is still widely used although inappropriate for screening: 24.9% of physicians report using only in-office tests and another 52.9% report using both in-office and home tests. Recommendations improved for follow-up after a positive test: fewer physicians recommend repeating the FOBT (17.8%) or using tests other than colonoscopy for the diagnostic work-up (6.6%).

The authors assessed characteristics associated with not discussing therapy effects on fertility or fertility preservation options, and not making fertility preservation arrangements. RESULTS: Males without a medical oncologist were more likely not to be told that therapy might affect fertility than those with a medical oncologist (male odds ratio [OR], 2.28; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.03-5.00).

OBJECTIVE: To describe 15-yr survival outcomes and cancer therapy utilization among men 65 years and older managed conservatively for newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a population-based cohort study with participants living in predefined geographic areas covered by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. The study includes 31 137 Medicare patients aged >/=65 yr diagnosed with localized prostate cancer in 1992-2009 who initially received conservative management (no surgery, radiotherapy, cryotherapy, or androgen deprivation therapy [ADT]). All patients were followed until death or December 31, 2009 (for prostate cancer-specific mortality [PCSM]) and December 31, 2011 (for overall mortality). OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Competing-risk analyses were used to examine PCSM, overall mortality, and utilization of cancer therapies. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The 15-yr risk of PCSM for men aged 65-74 yr diagnosed with screening-detected prostate cancer was 5.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.7-8.0%) for T1c Gleason 5-7 and 22% (95% CI 16-35%) for Gleason 8-10 disease. After 15 yr of follow-up, 24% (95% CI 21-27%) of men aged 65-74 yr with screening-detected Gleason 5-7 cancer received ADT. The corresponding result for men with Gleason 8-10 cancer was 38% (95% CI 32-44%). The major study limitations are the lack of data for men aged <65 yr and detailed clinical information associated with secondary cancer therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The 15-yr outcomes following conservative management of newly diagnosed Gleason 5-7 prostate cancer among men aged >/=65 yr are excellent. Men with Gleason 8-10 disease managed conservatively face a significant risk of PCSM.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis for women >or=40 years using data from the 2000 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) Cancer Control Module linked with state characteristics. Descriptive tabulations and logistic regressions were used to examine characteristics associated with out-of-pocket payment for a woman's most recent mammogram for the subset of approximately 7000 women reporting a mammogram within the past 2 years. RESULTS: In 2000, the majority of women who received a mammogram within the past 2 years paid no out-of-pocket costs: 68% among those aged 40-64 and 85% among those aged >or=66. Among women aged 40-64 with a recent mammogram, characteristics associated with paying out-of-pocket for the last mammogram were white, non-Hispanic race/ethnicity, being uninsured, having non-HMO private coverage, place of residence outside the Northeast, in a non-metropolitan county, and in a state with low HMO penetration. CONCLUSIONS: Public insurance and HMO coverage have been especially effective in eliminating financial barriers to mammography, but women 40-64 years with public coverage still lag behind their privately insured counterparts in using mammography.

The goal of this study was to identify product choice for initial tobacco trial, correlates associated with product choice, and the relationship between first product and current cigarette smoking among college students. METHODS: A cross-sectional web survey of 3146 first-year students at 11 universities in North Carolina and Virginia was conducted in fall 2010. RESULTS: Weighted prevalence of ever use of tobacco was 48.6%. Cigarettes were the most common first product (37.9%), followed by cigars (29.3%), hookahs (24.6%), smokeless tobacco (6.1%), and bidis/kreteks (2.2%). Two thirds (65%) of current smokers initiated with cigarettes, but 16.4% started with cigars, 11.1% with hookahs, 5.7% with smokeless, and 1.7% with bidis/kreteks. Females were more likely to report their first product was cigarettes and hookahs, while males were more likely to start with cigars and smokeless tobacco. Compared to those whose first product trial occurred after the age of 18, younger age of initiation (17years or younger) was associated with cigarettes and smokeless as first products, while older age of initiation (18 or older) was associated with starting with hookahs and cigars. Dual or poly tobacco use was more common among those who initiated with hookahs and smokeless tobacco. CONCLUSIONS: While over a third of students used cigarettes first, two thirds started with a non-cigarette product. Just about a third of current cigarette smokers initiated with a non-cigarette product, suggesting that those non-cigarette products may have facilitated escalation to cigarettes.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26265038,0,0,1,1

This study comprehensively investigated associations between genetic variants in FOCM and CRC risk and whether the FOCM nutrient status modified these associations. METHODS: Two hundred eighty-eight candidate and tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 30 FOCM genes were genotyped for 821 incident CRC case-control matched pairs in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study cohort. FOCM biomarkers (red blood cell [RBC] folate, plasma folate, pyridoxal-5'-phosphate [PLP], vitamin B12, and homocysteine) and self-reported alcohol consumption were measured at the baseline. Conditional logistic regression was implemented; effect modification was examined on the basis of known enzyme-nutrient relations. RESULTS: Statistically significant associations were observed between CRC risk and functionally defined candidate SNPs of methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1 (MTHFD1; K134R), 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase reductase (MTRR; P450R), and PR domain containing 2 with ZNF domain (PRDM2; S450N) and a literature candidate SNP of thymidylate synthase (TYMS; g.676789A>T; nominal P < .05).

METHODS: Timely follow-up of abnormal mammogram and fecal occult blood testing or fecal immunochemical tests (FOBT/FIT) were compared by race/ethnicity using Population-Based Research Optimizing Screening through Personalized Regimens consortium data. Participants were women with an abnormal mammogram (aged 40-75 years) or FOBT/FIT (aged 50-75 years) in 2010-2012. Analyses were performed in 2015. Timely follow-up was defined as colonoscopy </=3 months following positive FOBT/FIT; additional imaging or biopsy </=3 months following Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System Category 0, 4, or 5 mammograms; or </=9 months following Category 3 mammograms. Logistic regression was used to model receipt of timely follow-up adjusting for study site, age, year, insurance, and income. RESULTS: Among 166,602 mammograms, 10.7% were abnormal; among 566,781 FOBT/FITs, 4.3% were abnormal. Nearly 96% of patients with abnormal mammograms received timely follow-up versus 68% with abnormal FOBT/FIT. There was greater variability in receipt of follow-up across healthcare systems for positive FOBT/FIT than for abnormal mammograms.

CRC screening with a fecal immunochemical test (FIT) is important as occult blood may be detected. To offer Iowa Research Network members in family physician offices the opportunity to provide FITs at no charge to patients in need and determine how many of the tests would be handed out to patients and how many would be returned to the office. Eight family physician offices agreed to participate and 50 two-day FITs were provided, potentially providing 400 patients a CRC screening test. One hundred and eighty (45%) of the 400 FITs were handed out to patients. Of the 92 (51%) patients who returned at least one card, 77 (84%) had negative results, 13 (14%) were positive, and 2 (2 %) were indeterminate. Of 13 patients with a positive result, 11 (85%) had a follow-up colonoscopy. Providing 400 FITs at no charge to the offices was an expensive endeavor. Implementing this forced a change in office routine and the type of fecal occult blood test used. Less than half of the FITs were given out to patients and of those given out, about half of the patients returned a FIT. For those who returned FITs and had positive findings, 85% followed-up with a colonoscopy. Office nurses implementing the CRC screening need to be included in the planning of the type of fecal occult blood test used and receptive to the project.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Colorectal, Digestive Organs",Office of the Director,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=25980522,0,0,1,1

Findings from basic behavioral and social sciences research hold great promise for addressing behaviorally based clinical health problems, yet there is currently no established pathway for translating fundamental behavioral science discoveries into health-related treatments ready for Phase III efficacy testing. This article provides a systematic framework for developing behavioral treatments for preventing and treating chronic diseases. METHOD: The Obesity-Related Behavioral Intervention Trials (ORBIT) model for behavioral treatment development features a flexible and progressive process, prespecified clinically significant milestones for forward movement, and return to earlier stages for refinement and optimization. RESULTS: This article presents the background and rationale for the ORBIT model, a summary of key questions for each phase, a selection of study designs and methodologies well-suited to answering these questions, and prespecified milestones for forward or backward movement across phases. CONCLUSIONS: The ORBIT model provides a progressive, clinically relevant approach to increasing the number of evidence-based behavioral treatments available to prevent and treat chronic diseases.

METHODS: In two experiments, we tracked the allocation of attention while participants (n=125) viewed novel and commercial packages with varied FOP designs using a change detection methodology. RESULTS: We found empirical evidence that FOP labels are attended more often, and earlier, than the currently mandated NFP, and that this benefit is due both to its placement on the front of the package and to the design characteristics of the FOP. Specifically, the use of color in FOPs increased attention to the label, but there was no evidence that coding information via facial icons impacted attention. CONCLUSIONS: Our work supports a growing body of evidence supporting the use of FOP labels to attract attention to nutritional information.

OBJECTIVE: We conducted a population-based assessment of the barriers faced by people searching for cancer information. DESIGN: Cross-sectional data from the National Cancer Institute's 2003 Health Information National Trends Survey. PARTICIPANTS: A nationally representative sample of individuals in the USA (n = 6,369). MEASUREMENTS: We assessed whether respondents had ever sought cancer-related information and examined ratings of their information-seeking experiences and beliefs regarding causes of cancer and its prevention. Linear and logistic regression models were estimated to determine predictors of negative experiences and associations between experiences and cancer beliefs. RESULTS: Nearly one half (44.9%) of Americans had searched for cancer information. Many reported negative experiences, including the search process requiring a lot of effort (47.7%), expressing frustration (41.3%), and concerns about the quality of the information found (57.7%).

Addict Behav 2015;49:33-39",2015,"Gender differences in the associations among marijuana use, cigarette use, and symptoms of depression during adolescence and young adulthood","INTRODUCTION: As prevalence of marijuana use increases, it is important that we better understand how factors like gender, cigarette use, and depression are related to marijuana use during adolescence and young adulthood. We examined longitudinal relationships among these variables in adolescents moving into young adulthood who were studied longitudinally for six years. METHODS: 1263 individuals were included in the study. Participants were oversampled for ever-smoking a cigarette at baseline, when they were 15-16 years old. Frequency of cigarette smoking and marijuana use, as well as depression symptoms, were assessed at baseline, 6, 15, 24, 60 and 72 months. RESULTS: Cigarette use frequency and depression symptoms were associated with frequency of marijuana use (p-values<.001), particularly in adolescence, but there were important gender differences in these relationships. Specifically, symptoms of depression were related to marijuana use frequency among males (p<.001), but not females (p=.62). In addition, frequency of marijuana use was associated with increased cigarette use frequency, especially among males who had higher symptoms of depression (p<.001). However, this effect was not seen among females. Exploratory analyses suggested that relationships between frequency of use and depression are specific to marijuana, not cigarettes. CONCLUSIONS: Marijuana use is strongly related to depression symptoms and cigarette use frequency in males, indicating that in males these detrimental factors converge, whereas in females they do not. Gender differences in the factors related to marijuana use may mean that there are different risks for and consequences from use and have implications for prevention and intervention efforts.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26036667,0,0,0,1

Gut 2015;64(10):1623-1636",2015,Genetic architecture of colorectal cancer,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a complex disease that develops as a consequence of both genetic and environmental risk factors. A small proportion (3-5%) of cases arise from hereditary syndromes predisposing to early onset CRC as a result of mutations in over a dozen well defined genes. In contrast, CRC is predominantly a late onset 'sporadic' disease, developing in individuals with no obvious hereditary syndrome. In recent years, genome wide association studies have discovered that over 40 genetic regions are associated with weak effects on sporadic CRC, and it has been estimated that increasingly large genome wide scans will identify many additional novel genetic regions. Subsequent experimental validations have identified the causally related variant(s) in a limited number of these genetic regions. Further biological insight could be obtained through ethnically diverse study populations, larger genetic sequencing studies and development of higher throughput functional experiments. Along with inherited variation, integration of the tumour genome may shed light on the carcinogenic processes in CRC. In addition to summarising the genetic architecture of CRC, this review discusses genetic factors that modify environmental predictors of CRC, as well as examples of how genetic insight has improved clinical surveillance, prevention and treatment strategies. In summary, substantial progress has been made in uncovering the genetic architecture of CRC, and continued research efforts are expected to identify additional genetic risk factors that further our biological understanding of this disease. Subsequently these new insights will lead to improved treatment and prevention of colorectal cancer.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Colorectal, Digestive Organs",Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26187503,0,1,0,1

Cognitive and affective content were important predictors of behavior. Counselor cognitive content was associated with ovarian screening. An interaction effect also emerged for CA-125, such that counselor cognitive content plus participant cognitive content or counselor affective content were associated with more screening.

We conducted a genome wide (450K loci) methylation analysis to determine if there were differences in DNA methylation patterns between tumors from AA and EA women and if these differences were similar for both ER positive and ER negative breast cancer. Methylation levels at CpG loci within CpG islands (CGI)s and CGI-shores were significantly higher in tumors (n=138) than in reduction mammoplasty samples (n=124). In hierarchical cluster analysis, there was separation between tumor and normal samples, and in tumors, there was delineation by ER status, but not by ancestry. However, differential methylation analysis identified 157 CpG loci with a mean beta value difference of at least 0.17 between races, with almost twice as many differences in ER-negative tumors compared to ER-positive cancers. This first genome-wide methylation study to address disparities indicates that there are likely differing etiologic pathways for the development of ER negative breast cancer between AA and EA women. Further investigation of the genes most differentially methylated by race in ER negative tumors can guide new approaches for cancer prevention and targeted therapies, and elucidate the biologic basis of breast cancer disparities.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Breast,Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=24368439,0,1,1,1

METHODS: This paper reviews the published literature from 1966 to July 2002 to assess three potential pathways underlying this excess mortality--high human papilloma virus (HPV) prevalence, lack of or infrequent screening and advanced disease at diagnosis, and under-use of recommended treatment and shorter survival.

Recent reports of germline ETV6 variations associated with substantial familial clustering of haematological malignancies indicated that this gene is a potentially important genetic determinant for ALL susceptibility. Our aims in this study were to comprehensively identify ALL predisposition variants in ETV6 and to determine the extent to which they contributed to the overall risk of childhood ALL. METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing of an index family with several cases of ALL was done to identify causal variants for ALL predisposition. Targeted sequencing of ETV6 was done in children from the Children's Oncology Group and St Jude Children's Research Hospital front-line ALL trials. Patients were included in this study on the basis of their enrolment in these clinical trials and the availability of germline DNA. ETV6 variant genotypes were compared with non-ALL controls to define ALL-related germline risk variants. ETV6 variant function was characterised bioinformatically and correlated with clinical and demographic features in children with ALL. FINDINGS: We identified a novel non-sense ETV6 variant (p.Arg359X) with a high penetrance in an index family. Subsequent targeted sequencing of ETV6 in 4405 childhood ALL cases identified 31 exonic variants (four non-sense, 21 missense, one splice site, and five frameshift variants) that were potentially related to ALL risk in 35 cases (1%). 15 (48%) of 31 ALL-related ETV6 variants clustered in the erythroblast transformation specific domain and were predicted to be highly deleterious. Children with ALL-related ETV6 variants were significantly older at leukaemia diagnosis than those without (10.2 years [IQR 5.3-13.8] vs 4.7 years [3.0-8.7]; p=0.017). The hyperdiploid leukaemia karyotype was highly over-represented in ALL cases harbouring germline ETV6 risk variants compared with the wild-type group (nine [64%] of 14 cases vs 538 [27%] of 2007 cases; p=0.0050). INTERPRETATION: Our findings indicated germline ETV6 variations as the basis of a novel genetic syndrome associated with predisposition to childhood ALL.

J Natl Cancer Inst 2015;107(11)",2015,"Germline mutations in the BRIP1, BARD1, PALB2, and NBN genes in women with ovarian cancer","BACKGROUND: Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal gynecological malignancy, responsible for 13 000 deaths per year in the United States. Risk prediction based on identifying germline mutations in ovarian cancer susceptibility genes could have a clinically significant impact on reducing disease mortality. METHODS: Next generation sequencing was used to identify germline mutations in the coding regions of four candidate susceptibility genes-BRIP1, BARD1, PALB2 and NBN-in 3236 invasive EOC case patients and 3431 control patients of European origin, and in 2000 unaffected high-risk women from a clinical screening trial of ovarian cancer (UKFOCSS). For each gene, we estimated the prevalence and EOC risks and evaluated associations between germline variant status and clinical and epidemiological risk factor information. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: We found an increased frequency of deleterious mutations in BRIP1 in case patients (0.9%) and in the UKFOCSS participants (0.6%) compared with control patients (0.09%) (P = 1 x 10(-4) and 8 x 10(-4), respectively), but no differences for BARD1 (P = .39), NBN1 ( P = .61), or PALB2 (P = .08). There was also a difference in the frequency of rare missense variants in BRIP1 between case patients and control patients (P = 5.5 x 10(-4)). The relative risks associated with BRIP1 mutations were 11.22 for invasive EOC (95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.22 to 34.10, P = 1 x 10(-4)) and 14.09 for high-grade serous disease (95% CI = 4.04 to 45.02, P = 2 x 10(-5)). Segregation analysis in families estimated the average relative risks in BRIP1 mutation carriers compared with the general population to be 3.41 (95% CI = 2.12 to 5.54, P = 7x10(-7)). CONCLUSIONS: Deleterious germline mutations in BRIP1 are associated with a moderate increase in EOC risk. These data have clinical implications for risk prediction and prevention approaches for ovarian cancer and emphasize the critical need for risk estimates based on very large sample sizes before genes of moderate penetrance have clinical utility in cancer prevention.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Ovary, Female Genital Organs",Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26315354,0,1,0,0

The objectives of this study were to examine trajectories of physical activity (PA) and physical function (PF) over a 2-year lifestyle counseling study and to identify characteristics of the trajectory groups. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of Reach Out to Enhance Wellness, a randomized controlled trial of home-based lifestyle counseling. The 641 participants were older (>/=65 years), overweight (body mass index [BMI], 25 to <40 kg/m(2)), long-term community-dwelling survivors (>5 years) of breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer from Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States (21 states) who had been randomly assigned to an immediate intervention or a 12-month-wait-listed control arm. The main outcome measures were PA and PF trajectory group membership. RESULTS: Three PA groups and 5 PF trajectory groups were observed. The baseline BMI (P < .001) and self-efficacy for performing strength (P < .0001) and endurance exercises (P < .0002) were the strongest predictors of achieving the highest amount of PA and the most favorable functional trajectory over 2 years. Individuals with low baseline self-efficacy, no PA, and a Short Form 36 PF subscale score < 65 did not benefit from the intervention.

Prev Med 2015;80:53-59",2015,Health behavior change following a diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ: an opportunity to improve health outcomes,"Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a non-invasive breast cancer that comprises approximately 20% of new breast cancer diagnoses. DCIS is predominantly detected by screening mammography prior to the development of any clinical symptoms. Prognosis following a DCIS diagnosis is excellent, due to both the availability of effective treatments and the frequently benign nature of the disease. However, a DCIS diagnosis and its treatment have psychological and physical impacts that often lead to adverse changes in health-related behaviors, including changes in physical activity, body weight, alcohol intake, and smoking, which may represent a greater threat to the woman's overall health than the DCIS itself. Depending on age at diagnosis, women diagnosed with DCIS are 3-13 times more likely to die from non-breast cancer related causes, such as cardiovascular disease, than from breast cancer. Thus, the maintenance and improvement of healthy behaviors that influence a variety of outcomes after diagnosis may warrant increased attention during DCIS management. This may also represent an important opportunity to promote the adoption of healthy behaviors, given that DCIS carries the psychological impact of a cancer diagnosis but also a favorable prognosis. Particular focus is needed to address these issues in vulnerable patient subgroups with pre-existing higher rates of unhealthy behaviors and demonstrated health disparities.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Breast,Healthcare Delivery Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=25858806,0,0,1,0

Health care system collaboration to address chronic diseases: a nationwide snapshot from state public health practitioners. Prev Chronic Dis 2014;11",2014,Health care system collaboration to address chronic diseases: a nationwide snapshot from state public health practitioners,"INTRODUCTION: Until recently, health care systems in the United States often lacked a unified approach to prevent and manage chronic disease. Recent efforts have been made to close this gap through various calls for increased collaboration between public health and health care systems to better coordinate provision of services and programs. Currently, the extent to which the public health workforce has responded is relatively unknown. The objective of this study is to explore health care system collaboration efforts and activities among a population-based sample of state public health practitioners. METHODS: During spring 2013, a national survey was administered to state-level chronic disease public health practitioners. Respondents were asked to indicate whether or not they collaborate with health care systems. Those who reported ""yes"" were asked to indicate all topic areas in which they collaborate and provide qualitative examples of their collaborative work. RESULTS: A total of 759 respondents (84%) reported collaboration. Common topics of collaboration activities were tobacco, cardiovascular health, and cancer screening. More client-oriented interventions than system-wide interventions were found in the qualitative examples provided. Respondents who collaborated were also more likely to use the Community Guide, use evidence-based decision making, and work in program areas that involved secondary, rather than primary, prevention. CONCLUSION: The study findings indicate a need for greater guidance on collaboration efforts that involve system-wide and cross-system interventions. Tools such as the Community Guide and evidence-based training courses may be useful in providing such guidance.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=25188277,0,1,0,0

We sought to characterize the relationship between mammography and potentially modifiable factors, with the goal of identifying targets for intervention to improve utilization. METHODS: Of 625 female participants sampled from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, who were treated with chest radiotherapy, 551 responded to a survey about breast cancer screening practices. We used multivariate Poisson regression to assess several lifestyle and emotional factors, health care practices, and perceived breast cancer risk, in relation to reporting a screening mammogram within the last two years. RESULTS: Women who had a Papanicolaou test [prevalence ratio (PR): 1.77; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26-2.49], and who perceived their breast cancer risk as higher than the average woman were more likely to have had a mammogram (PR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.09-1.46). We detected an attenuated effect of echocardiogram screening [PR, 0.70; 95% CI (0.52-0.95)] on having a mammogram among older women compared with younger women. Smoking, obesity, physical activity, coping, and symptoms of depression and somatization were not associated with mammographic screening. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that compliance with routine and risk-based screening can be an important indicator of mammography in childhood cancer survivors. In addition, there is a need to ensure women understand their increased breast cancer risk, as a means to encouraging them to follow breast surveillance guidelines. IMPACT: Screening encounters could be used to promote mammography compliance in this population.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Breast,Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26304504,0,0,1,1

This study presents nationally representative estimates of annual out-of-pocket (OOP) burden among non-elderly cancer survivors and assesses the association between high OOP burden and access to care and preventive service utilization. METHODS: Using the 2008-2012 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, 4,271 cancer survivors and 96,780 individuals without a history of cancer were identified, all aged 18-64 years. High annual OOP burden was defined as spending >20% of annual family income on OOP healthcare costs. Associations between high OOP burden and access to care were evaluated with multivariable logistic regression. Analyses were conducted in 2015. RESULTS: Compared with individuals without a cancer history, cancer survivors were more likely to report a high OOP burden (4.3% vs 3.4%, p=0.009) in adjusted analyses. High OOP burden was more common among cancer survivors who were poor (18.4%), with either public insurance (7.9%) or uninsured (5.7%), and not working (10.2%). Among cancer survivors, high OOP burden was associated with being unable to obtain necessary medical care (19.2% vs 12.5%, p=0.002), delaying necessary medical care (21.6% vs 13.8%, p=0.002), and lower breast cancer screening rates among age-appropriate women (63.2% vs 75.9%, p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: High OOP burden is more common among adults with a cancer history than those without a cancer history.

This study examined experience of care among cancer survivors and assessed associations of survivors' characteristics with their experience. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a newly-developed, unique data resource, SEER-CAHPS (NCI's Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results [SEER] data linked to Medicare Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems [CAHPS] survey responses), to examine experiences of care among breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer survivors age >66 years who completed CAHPS >1year after cancer diagnosis and survived >/=1 year after survey completion. Experience of care was assessed by survivor-provided scores for overall care, health plan, physicians, customer service, doctor communication, and aspects of care. Multivariable logistic regression models assessed associations of survivors' sociodemographic and clinical characteristics with care experience. RESULTS: Among 19,455 cancer survivors with SEER-CAHPS data, higher self-reported general-health status was significantly associated with better care experiences for breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer survivors. In contrast, better mental-health status was associated with better care experience for lung cancer survivors. College-educated and Asian survivors were less likely to indicate high scores for care experiences. Few differences in survivors' experiences were observed by sex or years since diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The SEER-CAHPS data resources allows assessment of factors influencing experience of cancer among U.S. cancer survivors. Higher self-reported health status was associated with better experiences of care; other survivors' characteristics also predicted care experience. Interventions to improve cancer survivors' health status, such as increased access to supportive care services, may improve experience of care.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Colorectal, Prostate, Breast, Lung",Healthcare Delivery Research Program,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=29249645,0,1,0,0

However, the magnitude of the association, particularly by subtypes of breast cancer, has not been established. Furthermore, the mechanisms of the association remain unclear. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis to investigate associations between height and breast cancer risk using data from 159 prospective cohorts totaling 5216302 women, including 113178 events. In a consortium with individual-level data from 46325 case patients and 42482 control patients, we conducted a Mendelian randomization analysis using a genetic score that comprised 168 height-associated variants as an instrument. This association was further evaluated in a second consortium using summary statistics data from 16003 case patients and 41335 control patients. RESULTS: The pooled relative risk of breast cancer was 1.17 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.15 to 1.19) per 10cm increase in height in the meta-analysis of prospective studies. In Mendelian randomization analysis, the odds ratio of breast cancer per 10cm increase in genetically predicted height was 1.22 (95% CI = 1.13 to 1.32) in the first consortium and 1.21 (95% CI = 1.05 to 1.39) in the second consortium. The association was found in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women but restricted to hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Analyses of height-associated variants identified eight new loci associated with breast cancer risk after adjusting for multiple comparisons, including three loci at 1q21.2, DNAJC27, and CCDC91 at genome-wide significance level P < 5x10(-8). CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides strong evidence that adult height is a risk factor for breast cancer in women and certain genetic factors and biological pathways affecting adult height have an important role in the etiology of breast cancer.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Breast,Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26296642,0,1,1,0

Int J Cancer 2015;137(7):1691-1698",2015,High nevus counts confer a favorable prognosis in melanoma patients,"A high number of nevi is the most significant phenotypic risk factor for melanoma and is in part genetically determined. The number of nevi decreases from middle age onward but this senescence can be delayed in patients with melanoma. We investigated the effects of nevus number count on sentinel node status and melanoma survival in a large cohort of melanoma cases. Out of 2,184 melanoma cases, 684 (31.3%) had a high nevus count (>50). High nevus counts were associated with favorable prognostic factors such as lower Breslow thickness, less ulceration and lower mitotic rate, despite adjustment for age. Nevus count was not predictive of sentinel node status. The crude 5- and 10-year melanoma-specific survival rate was higher in melanomas cases with a high nevus count compared to those with a low nevus count (91.2 vs. 86.4% and 87.2 vs. 79%, respectively). The difference in survival remained significant after adjusting for all known melanoma prognostic factors (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.43, confidence interval [CI] = 0.21-0.89). The favorable prognostic value of a high nevus count was also seen within the positive sentinel node subgroup of patients (HR = 0.22, CI = 0.08-0.60). High nevus count is associated with a better melanoma survival, even in the subgroup of patients with positive sentinel lymph node.

A history of UL diagnosis has been associated with a higher risk of uterine malignancies. The relation between UL and breast cancer, another hormonally responsive cancer, has not been studied. METHODS: We investigated the association between self-reported physician-diagnosed UL and incidence of breast cancer in the Black Women's Health Study, a prospective cohort study. We followed 57,747 participants without a history of breast cancer from 1995 to 2013. UL diagnoses were reported at baseline and biennially. Breast cancer was reported on biennial questionnaires and confirmed by pathology data from medical records or cancer registries. Cox regression was used to derive incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) and adjust for potential confounders. RESULTS: There were 2,276 incident cases of breast cancer (1,699 invasive, 394 in situ, and 183 unknown) during 879,672 person-years of follow-up. The multivariable IRR for the overall association between history of UL and breast cancer incidence was 0.99 (95 % CI 0.90-1.08), with similar results for ER + (IRR = 1.03) and ER - breast cancer (IRR = 1.05). IRRs for early diagnosis of UL (before age 30) were slightly above 1.0, with IRRs of 1.14 (95 % CI 0.99-1.31) for overall breast cancer, 1.14 (95 % CI 0.93-1.40) for ER + breast cancer, and 1.20 (95 % CI 0.89-1.61) for ER - breast cancer. IRRs for early diagnosis of UL were elevated for breast cancer diagnosed before 40 years of age (IRR = 1.39, 95 % CI 0.97-1.99) and premenopausal breast cancer (IRR = 1.26, 95 % CI 1.01-1.58). No consistent patterns in risk were observed across estrogen receptor subtypes, and IRRs did not differ appreciably within strata of BMI, female hormone use, mammography recency, or family history of breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: The present study of US black women suggests that a history of UL diagnosis is unrelated to the incidence of breast cancer overall. The positive associations observed for early diagnosed UL with breast cancer before age 40 and with premenopausal breast cancer require confirmation in future studies.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Breast,Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26250515,0,1,0,1

The odds ratio (ORs) for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) associated with any pesticide exposure shortly before conception, during pregnancy and after birth were 1.39 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.25, 1.55) (using 2,785 cases and 3,635 controls), 1.43 (95% CI: 1.32, 1.54) (5,055 cases and 7,370 controls) and 1.36 (95% CI: 1.23, 1.51) (4,162 cases and 5,179 controls), respectively. Corresponding ORs for risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were 1.49 (95% CI: 1.02, 2.16) (173 cases and 1,789 controls), 1.55 (95% CI: 1.21, 1.99) (344 cases and 4,666 controls) and 1.08 (95% CI: 0.76, 1.53) (198 cases and 2,655 controls), respectively. There was little difference by type of pesticide used. The relative similarity in ORs between leukemia types, time periods and pesticide types may be explained by similar exposure patterns and effects across the time periods in ALL and AML, participants' exposure to multiple pesticides, or recall bias. Although some recall bias is likely, until a better study design can be found to investigate the associations between home pesticide use and childhood leukemia in an equally large sample, it would appear prudent to limit the use of home pesticides before and during pregnancy, and during childhood.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Leukemia, Lymph/Blood",Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26061779,0,0,0,1

METHODS: A cross-sectional Web-based survey of a random sample of 1332 undergraduate students (Mean Age = 21.2 years) attending a United States university. RESULTS: The majority of respondents (72.8%) had ever smoked hookah tobacco, and 28% of those had ever smoked during adolescence. The majority of ever hookah smokers (81.5%) and a portion of never hookah smokers (20%) had ever been to a hookah lounge. The adjusted odds of ever visiting a hookah lounge were 2.1 times higher among participants who reported that the closest hookah lounge to the university was < 5 miles away than those who reported that the closest hookah lounge was >/= 5 miles away. Facilitators of visiting hookah lounges included friends and close proximity of hookah lounges to campus; barriers included cost of smoking hookah, crowded lounges, and having to be 18 years old. CONCLUSION: Youth are vulnerable to experimenting with hookah tobacco smoking. Hookah lounges provide patrons the opportunity to smoke hookah tobacco with smoker and non-smoker friends in entertaining settings. Our findings suggest that zoning laws and anti-hookah smoking legislation may help curb hookah uptake by prohibiting hookah lounges from opening in close proximity to universities, reducing the density of hookah lounges in cities, and raising the admission age for hookah lounges to 21 years.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26450551,0,0,0,1

Exploring associations and pathways,"Purpose: Perceived quality of care (QOC) is an increasingly important metric of care quality and can be affected by such factors among patients with cancer as quality of life and physician trust. This study sought to evaluate whether informal caregiver well-being was also associated with perceived QOC among patients with cancer and assessed potential pathways that link these factors. Methods: This study used data from the Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance (CanCORS) consortium. Patients with lung and colorectal cancer enrolled in CanCORS (N = 689) nominated an informal caregiver to participate in a caregiving survey. Both groups self-reported sociodemographic, psychosocial, and caregiving characteristics; cancer characteristics were obtained from the CanCORS core data set. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the association between caregiver psychosocial factors and subsequent patient-perceived QOC, controlling for earlier patient-perceived QOC and covariates. Secondary analysis examined potential pathways that link these factors. Results: Patients whose informal caregiver had higher levels of depressive symptoms were significantly more likely to report fair or poor QOC (odds ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.13). When caregivers reported fair or poor self-rated health, patients were more than three times more likely to report fair or poor perceived QOC (odds ratio, 3.76; 95% CI, 1.76 to 9.55). Controlling for patient psychosocial factors and physician communication and coordination of medical care reduced the effect size and/or statistical significance of these relationships. Conclusion: Informal caregivers are an important part of the care team and their well-being is associated with patient-perceived QOC. Engaging informal cancer caregivers as part of the care team and conducting ongoing risk stratification screening and intervention to optimize their health may improve patient-reported outcomes and QOC.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Colorectal, Lung","Behavioral Research Program, Healthcare Delivery Research Program",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27573657,0,0,1,0

Despite the surfeit of health information from commercial and noncommercial sources, national and international surveys show that many people lack basic numerical skills that are essential to maintain their health and make informed medical decisions. Low numeracy distorts perceptions of risks and benefits of screening, reduces medication compliance, impedes access to treatments, impairs risk communication (limiting prevention efforts among the most vulnerable), and, based on the scant research conducted on outcomes, appears to adversely affect medical outcomes. Low numeracy is also associated with greater susceptibility to extraneous factors (i.e., factors that do not change the objective numerical information). That is, low numeracy increases susceptibility to effects of mood or how information is presented (e.g., as frequencies vs. percentages) and to biases in judgment and decision making (e.g., framing and ratio bias effects). Much of this research is not grounded in empirically supported theories of numeracy or mathematical cognition, which are crucial for designing evidence-based policies and interventions that are effective in reducing risk and improving medical decision making. To address this gap, we outline four theoretical approaches (psychophysical, computational, standard dual-process, and fuzzy trace theory), review their implications for numeracy, and point to avenues for future research","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,"Basic Biobehavioral Research Branch, Behavioral Research Program",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=19883143,0,0,0,0

RESULTS: From 1131 original study participants, 807 (71%) completed a survey about the HPV vaccine for their daughters and themselves. Nearly half, 380 (47%), of the participants had heard of a vaccine to prevent cancer, and 362 (95%) of respondents had heard of HPV.

Although such assessments have historically been resource intensive, development and use of purchase tasks-in which participants purchase 1 or more hypothetical or real commodities across a range of prices-have made data collection more practical and have increased the rate of scientific discovery. However, extraneous sources of variability occasionally produce nonsystematic demand data, in which price exerts either no or inconsistent effects on the purchases of individual participants. Such data increase measurement error, can often not be interpreted in light of research aims, and likely obscure effects of the variable(s) under investigation. Using data from 494 participants, we introduce and evaluate an algorithm (derived from prior methods) for identifying nonsystematic demand data, wherein individual participants' demand functions are judged against 2 general, empirically based assumptions: (a) global, price-dependent reduction in consumption and (b) consistency in purchasing across prices. We also introduce guidelines for handling nonsystematic data, noting some conditions in which excluding such data from primary analyses may be appropriate and others in which doing so may bias conclusions.

Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol 2015;13(10):1730",2015,Identification of serum markers of esophageal adenocarcinoma by global and targeted metabolic profiling,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: We aimed to identify new serum biomarkers of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). METHODS: We performed metabolomic analyses of serum samples from 2 sets of case-control pairs in the discovery phase, each consisting of 30 patients with histologically confirmed EAC (cases) from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and 30 matched subjects without EAC (controls). We identified metabolites whose levels differed significantly between cases and controls and validated those with the greatest difference in an analysis of 321 EAC cases and 331 controls. We generated a metabolite risk score (MRS) for the metabolites. RESULTS: The levels of 64 metabolites differed significantly between EAC cases and controls in the discovery phase. The metabolites with the greatest difference were amino acid L-proline (LP), ketone body 3-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA), and carbohydrate D-mannose (DM); these differences were confirmed in the validation set. Cases had lower mean levels of LP than controls (22.78 +/- 6.79 mug/mL vs 28.24 +/- 8.64 mug/mL; P < .001) and higher levels of BHBA (18.06 +/- 17.84 mug/mL vs 7.73 +/- 9.92 mug/mL; P < .001) and DM (9.87 +/- 4.28 mug/mL vs 6.28 +/- 3.61 mug/mL; P < .001). Levels of DM were significantly higher in patients with late-stage EAC than early-stage EAC (10.61 +/- 4.79 mug/mL vs 8.97 +/- 3.36 mug/mL; P = .005). Higher levels of LP were associated with significant decrease in risk of EAC (odds ratio [OR], 0.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.18-0.38). A significant increase in risk of EAC was associated with higher levels of BHBA (OR, 4.05; 95% CI, 2.84-5.78) and DM (OR, 7.04; 95% CI, 4.79-10.34). Levels of all 3 metabolites associated with EAC risk in a dose response manner; the level of risk conferred by the metabolites increased jointly with smoking status and body mass index. Individuals with high MRS had significant (7.76-fold) increase in risk of EAC vs those with low MRS. Smokers with high MRS had the greatest risk of EAC (OR, 23.40; 95% CI, 10.95-50.00), compared with never smokers with low MRS. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of a case vs control metabolic profile analysis, levels of LP, BHBA, and DM are associated with risk of EAC. These markers might be used as risk and prognostic factors for patients with EAC.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Esophagus, Digestive Organs",Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=25998788,0,1,0,1

Automated methods to measure travel behaviors will improve research in this area. In this paper, we present a supervised machine learning method for transportation mode prediction from global positioning system (GPS) and accelerometer data. METHODS: We collected a dataset of about 150 h of GPS and accelerometer data from two research assistants following a protocol of prescribed trips consisting of five activities: bicycling, riding in a vehicle, walking, sitting, and standing. We extracted 49 features from 1-min windows of this data. We compared the performance of several machine learning algorithms and chose a random forest algorithm to classify the transportation mode. We used a moving average output filter to smooth the output predictions over time. RESULTS: The random forest algorithm achieved 89.8% cross-validated accuracy on this dataset. Adding the moving average filter to smooth output predictions increased the cross-validated accuracy to 91.9%. CONCLUSION: Machine learning methods are a viable approach for automating measurement of active travel, particularly for measuring travel activities that traditional accelerometer data processing methods misclassify, such as bicycling and vehicle travel.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Healthcare Delivery Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=24795875,1,0,0,0

METHODS: To select epidemiologic risk factors for use in the classifier, Cox proportional hazards analyses were conducted using 74,786 Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Observational Study (OS) participants. To construct a combination classifier, 210 WHI OS cases and 536 matched controls with serum marker measurements were analyzed; validation employed 143 cases and 725 matched controls from the WHI Clinical Trial (CT) with similar data. RESULTS: Analyses identified a combination risk classifier composed of two elevated-risk groups: 1) women with CA125 or HE4 exceeding a 98% specificity threshold; and 2) women with intact fallopian tubes, prior use of menopausal hormone therapy for at least two years, and either a first degree relative with breast or ovarian cancer or a personal history of breast cancer. In the WHI OS population, it classified 13% of women as elevated risk, identifying 30% of ovarian cancers diagnosed up to 7.8years post-enrollment (Hazard Ratio [HR]=2.6, p<0.001). In the WHI CT validation population, it classified 8% of women as elevated risk, identifying 31% of cancers diagnosed within 7years of enrollment (HR=4.6, p<0.001).

METHODS: We evaluated the validity of Medicare claims to identify receipt of chemotherapy and specific agents delivered to elderly stage II/III colorectal (CRC), in situ/early-stage breast, non-small-cell lung, and ovarian cancer patients using the National Cancer Institute's Patterns of Care studies (POC) as the gold standard. The POC collected data on chemotherapy treatment by reabstracting hospital records, contacting physicians, and reviewing medical records. Patients' POC data were linked and compared with their Medicare claims for 2 to 12 months postdiagnosis. kappa, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for the receipt of any chemotherapy and specific agents. RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity of Medicare claims to identify any chemotherapy were high across all cancer sites. We found substantial variation in validity across agents, by site and administration modality.

Annu Rev Public Health 2015;36:289-306",2015,Identifying the effects of environmental and policy change interventions on healthy eating,"Obesity has been characterized as a disease. Strategies to change the incidence and prevalence of this disease include a focus on changing physical and social environments, over and above individual-level strategies, using a multilevel or systems approach. We focus our attention on evidence published between 2008 and 2013 on the effectiveness of interventions in nutrition environments, i.e., environmental interventions designed to influence the intake of healthful foods and amount of energy consumed. An overarching socioecological framework that has guided much of this research was used to characterize different types of environmental strategies. Intervention examples in each area of the framework are provided with a discussion of key findings and related conceptual and methodological issues. The emphasis in this review is on adults, but clearly this literature is only one part of the picture. Much research has been focused on child-specific interventions, including environmental interventions. Some evidence suggests effectiveness of policy-based or other types of interventions that aim to regulate or restructure environments to promote healthy dietary choices, and these strategies would apply to both children and adults. Opportunities to evaluate these policy changes in adults' social and physical environments are rare. Much of the existing research has been with children. As conceptual and methodological issues continue to be identified and resolved, we hope that future research in this domain will identify environmental strategies that can be included in intervention toolboxes to build healthy nutrition environments for both adults and children.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=25785891,0,0,0,1

DESIGN: We undertook an observational cohort study of women ages 40-80 years with 2 mammography screenings in an integrated delivery system. MEASURES: FP recall, defined as mammograms resulting in a radiologist's recommendation for additional imaging, ultrasound, or invasive procedures among disease-free women, was compared for nonusers, initiators, discontinuers, and continuers of HT. Differences in health care costs by HT were assessed for total, primary care, specialty, laboratory, radiology, inpatient, mental health, and pharmacy. RESULTS: There was no association between HT and FP recall among women ages 40-49 years. Among women 50 years or older, current HT users, ie, initiators and continuers, had increased odds of FP recall (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval) compared with nonusers (1.2; 1.0-1.4 for women 50-59 years; 1.8; 1.5-2.2 for women 60-69; and 1.7; 1.4-2.0 for women 70-80 years).

Multilevel modeling of perceived control ratings over a 2-year period revealed significant variation in individual trajectories: most participants showed increases (45 %) or no change (38.3 %), while 16.7 % showed decreases. At the group level, noncarriers reported sustained increases through the 2-year follow-up (ps < .05); unaffected carriers reported significant short-term increases (ps < .05); and affected carriers reported no change. Participants in all groups continued to rate photoprotection as highly effective in reducing melanoma risk and reported decreased beliefs that carrying the p16 mutation would inevitably lead to the development of melanoma. Qualitative responses immediately following counseling and test reporting corroborated these findings, as 93 % indicated it was possible to either prevent (64.9 %) or decrease the likelihood (28.1 %) of future melanomas. Thus, genetic test reporting does not generally undermine perceived control over melanoma prevention, though variability in response to positive results warrants future study.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Melanoma, Skin",Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=25822116,0,1,0,0

Cancers (Basel) 2014;6(1):580-594,2014,Impact of neuro-psychological factors on smoking-associated lung cancer,"Smoking has been extensively documented as a risk factor for all histological types of lung cancer and tobacco-specific nitrosamines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons reproducibly cause lung cancer in laboratory rodents. However, the most common lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), frequently develops in never smokers and is particularly common in women and African Americans, suggesting that factors unrelated to smoking significantly impact this cancer. Recent experimental investigations in vitro and in animal models have shown that chronic psychological stress and the associated hyperactive signaling of stress neurotransmitters via beta-adrenergic receptors significantly promote the growth and metastatic potential of NSCLC. These responses were caused by modulation in the expression and sensitization state of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) that regulate the production of stress neurotransmitters and the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Similar changes in nAChR-mediated neurotransmitter production were identified as the cause of NSCLC stimulation in vitro and in xenograft models by chronic nicotine. Collectively, these data suggest that hyperactivity of the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system caused by chronic psychological stress or chronic exposure to nicotinic agonists in cigarette smoke significantly contribute to the development and progression of NSCLC. A recent clinical study that reported improved survival outcomes with the incidental use of beta-blockers among patients with NSCLC supports this interpretation.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Lung,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=24633083,0,1,1,1

Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 2015;24(10):1523-1530",2015,Impact of risk assessment and tailored versus nontailored risk information on colorectal cancer testing in primary care: a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer screening is effective but underused. Guidelines for which tests are recommended and at what intervals depend on specific risks. We developed a tablet-based Cancer Risk Intake System (CRIS) that asks questions about risk prior to appointments and generates tailored printouts for patients and physicians summarizing and matching risk factors with guideline-based recommendations. METHODS: Randomized controlled trial among patients who: (i) used CRIS and they and their physicians received tailored printouts; (ii) used CRIS to answer questions but received standard information about cancer screening while their physicians received a standard electronic chart prompt indicating they were age-eligible but not currently adherent for colorectal cancer screening; or (iii) comprised a no-contact group that neither used CRIS nor received any information while their physicians received the standard prompt. Participation in testing was assessed via electronic medical record at 12 months. RESULTS: Participation in any colorectal cancer testing was three times higher for those who used the CRIS and received any printed materials, compared with no-contact controls (47% vs. 16%; P < 0.0001). Among CRIS users ages 50 and older, participation in any testing was higher in the tailored group (53% vs. 44%, P = 0.023). CONCLUSION: Use of CRIS and receipt of any information facilitated participation in testing. There was more testing participation in the CRIS-tailored than nontailored group. IMPACT: Asking patients questions about their specific risk factors and giving them and their providers information just prior to an appointment may increase participation in colorectal cancer testing. Tailoring the information has some added benefit.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Colorectal, Digestive Organs",Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26265201,0,0,1,1

Tob Control 2015;24",2015,Impact of the 'Giving Cigarettes is Giving Harm' campaign on knowledge and attitudes of Chinese smokers,"OBJECTIVE: To date there is limited published evidence on the efficacy of tobacco control mass media campaigns in China. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a mass media campaign 'Giving Cigarettes is Giving Harm' (GCGH) on Chinese smokers' knowledge of smoking-related harms and attitudes towards cigarette gifts. METHODS: Population-based, representative data were analysed from a longitudinal cohort of 3709 adult smokers who participated in the International Tobacco Control (ITC) China Survey conducted in six Chinese cities before and after the campaign. Logistic regression models were estimated to examine associations between campaign exposure and attitudes towards cigarette gifts measured post-campaign. Poisson regression models were estimated to assess the effects of campaign exposure on post-campaign knowledge, adjusting for pre-campaign knowledge. FINDINGS: Fourteen percent (n=335) of participants recalled the campaign within the cities where the GCGH campaign was implemented. Participants in the intervention cities who recalled the campaign were more likely to disagree that cigarettes are good gifts (71% vs 58%, p<0.01) and had greater levels of campaign-targeted knowledge than those who did not recall the campaign (mean=1.97 vs 1.62, p<0.01). Disagreeing that cigarettes are good gifts was higher in intervention cities than in control cities. Changes in campaign-targeted knowledge were similar in both cities, perhaps due to a secular trend, low campaign recall or contamination issues. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the GCGH campaign increased knowledge of smoking harms, which could promote downstream cessation. This study provides evidence to support future campaign development to effectively fight the tobacco epidemic in China.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=24813427,0,0,1,1

Multilevel influences, such as communities and families surrounding patients or health-care policies and organizations surrounding provider teams, may determine whether effective interventions are successfully implemented. Greater recognition of the importance of these influences in advancing (or hindering) the impact of single-level interventions has motivated the design and testing of multilevel interventions designed to address them. However, implementing research evidence from single- or multilevel interventions into sustainable routine practice and policy presents substantive challenges. Furthermore, relatively few multilevel interventions have been conducted along the cancer care continuum, and fewer still have been implemented, disseminated, or sustained in practice. The purpose of this chapter is, therefore, to illustrate and examine the concepts underlying the implementation and spread of multilevel interventions into routine practice and policy. We accomplish this goal by using a series of cancer and noncancer examples that have been successfully implemented and, in some cases, spread widely. Key concepts across these examples include the importance of phased implementation, recognizing the need for pilot testing, explicit engagement of key stakeholders within and between each intervention level; visible and consistent leadership and organizational support, including financial and human resources; better understanding of the policy context, fiscal climate, and incentives underlying implementation; explication of handoffs from researchers to accountable individuals within and across levels; ample integration of multilevel theories guiding implementation and evaluation; and strategies for long-term monitoring and sustainability","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Colorectal, Digestive Organs","Health Services and Economics Branch, Process of Care Research Branch, Behavioral Research Program, Applied Research Program",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=22623601,0,0,1,0

Current clinical practice guidelines were analyzed, and key informants were interviewed about organizational policies and procedures that ensure initial screening and follow-up of abnormal results. Data were analyzed across plans for several theoretically relevant domains, including leadership and policies, clinical decision support, delivery system design, clinical information systems, and patient self-management support. RESULTS: Practice guidelines were fundamentally similar across plans for both cancer screenings, although operationalization of risk and formatting of the written documents differed. These plans adopted a wide array of strategies, particularly in the clinical decision support, clinical information systems, and patient self-management support domains, but there is room for improvement.

It is generally assumed that the measurement of health inequalities is a value-neutral process, providing objective data that are then interpreted using normative judgments about whether a particular distribution of health is just, fair, or socially acceptable. METHODS: We discuss five examples in which normative judgments play a role in the measurement process itself, through either the selection of one measurement strategy to the exclusion of others or the selection of the type, significance, or weight assigned to the variables being measured. FINDINGS: Overall, we find that many commonly used measures of inequality are value laden and that the normative judgments implicit in these measures have important consequences for interpreting and responding to health inequalities. CONCLUSIONS: Because values implicit in the generation of health inequality measures may lead to radically different interpretations of the same underlying data, we urge researchers to explicitly consider and transparently discuss the normative judgments underlying their measures.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included mammograms from 1996 to 2001 from the seven mammography registries of the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC). The authors defined the pre-MQSA period as January 1, 1996-April 27, 1999, and the post-MQSA period as April 28, 1999-December 31, 2001 (2470151 screening and 194199 diagnostic mammograms). Assessment was cross-classified according to management recommendation. Changes in concordance between assessment and recommendation were evaluated by year and by period (before and after MQSA) for computer-linked data and for all data by using Pearson chi(2) test to evaluate differences. Mantel-Haenszel chi(2) test was used to measure change in concordance over time. Each registry and the BCSC Statistical Coordinating Center had a Federal Certificate of Confidentiality and approval from each institution's review board for protection of human subjects to collect and send data to coordinating center and conduct research with these data. Active consent was required at only one site in this HIPAA-compliant study. RESULTS: Concordance increased significantly in the post-MQSA period for Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System categories 3-5 assessments at both screening and diagnostic mammography. The most substantial improvements were in the use of the management recommendation for 'additional imaging,' which decreased from 41% in 1996 to 15% in 2001 for screening mammograms with an initial assessment of category 4 (P < .001). Recommendation for short-interval follow-up in women with screening mammograms with a category 3 final assessment increased from 51% in 1996 to 76% in 2001 (P < .001). Concordance for diagnostic mammograms assigned category 0 improved from 65% in the pre-MQSA period to 81% in the post-MQSA period (P < .001).

However, there are few studies that systematically document the behavioural features of physician compassion and the ways in which physicians communicate compassion to patients. OBJECTIVE: To develop a taxonomy of compassionate behaviours and statements expressed by the physician that can be discerned by an outside observer. DESIGN: Qualitative analysis of audio-recorded office visits between oncologists and patients with advanced cancer. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Oncologists (n = 23) and their patients with advanced cancer (n = 49) were recruited in the greater Rochester, New York, area. The physicians and patients were surveyed and had office visits audio recorded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Audio recordings were listened to for qualitative assessment of communication skills. RESULTS: Our sensitizing framework was oriented around three elements of compassion: recognition of the patient's suffering, emotional resonance and movement towards addressing suffering. Statements of compassion included direct statements, paralinguistic expressions and performative comments. Compassion frequently unfolded over the course of a conversation rather than being a single discrete event. Additionally, non-verbal linguistic elements (e.g. silence) were frequently employed to communicate emotional resonance. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to systematically catalogue instances of compassionate communication in physician-patient dialogues. Further refinement and validation of this preliminary taxonomy can guide future education and training interventions to facilitate compassion in physician-patient interactions.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=24305037,1,0,0,1

OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare the performance of 4 claims-based comorbidity measures. RESEARCH DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: We undertook a retrospective cohort study of 5777 Medicare beneficiaries ages 66 and older with stage III colon cancer reported to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program between January 1, 1992 and December 31, 1996. MEASURES: Comorbidity measures included Elixhauser's set of 30 condition indicators, Klabunde's outpatient and inpatient indices weighted for colorectal cancer patients, Diagnostic Cost Groups, and the Adjusted Clinical Group (ACG) System. Outcomes included receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy and 2 year noncancer mortality. RESULTS: For all measures, greater comorbidity significantly predicted lower receipt of chemotherapy and higher noncancer death. Nested logistic regression modeling suggests that using more claims sources to measure comorbidity generally improves the prediction of chemotherapy receipt and noncancer death, but depends on the measure type and outcome studied. All 4 comorbidity measures significantly improved the fit of baseline regression models for both chemotherapy receipt (baseline c-statistic 0.776; ranging from 0.779 after adding ACGs and Klabunde to 0.789 after Elixhauser) and noncancer death (baseline c-statistic 0.687; ranging from 0.717 after adding ACGs to 0.744 after Elixhauser). CONCLUSIONS: Although some comorbidity measures demonstrate minor advantages over others, each is fairly robust in predicting both chemotherapy receipt and noncancer death.

We investigated whether older breast cancer survivors have a similar comorbidity burden 6-15 years after cancer diagnosis to matched women free of breast cancer at start of follow-up and whether incident comorbidities are associated with all-cause mortality. In this prospective cohort study, 1,361 older 5-year early-stage breast cancer survivors diagnosed between 1990 and 1994 and 1,361 age- and health system-matched women were followed for 10 years.

Initiatives have focused on increasing accrual, but changes at the population-level are unknown. We examined patterns of clinical trial participation over time in AYA patients with cancer. PROCEDURE: We utilized medical record data from AYAs in two population-based National Cancer Institute Patterns of Care Studies identified through the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program. Among 3135 AYAs diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and sarcoma, we used multivariate logistic regression to evaluate patient and provider characteristics associated with clinical trial enrollment. Interaction terms evaluated variation in clinical trial enrollment across patient and provider characteristics by year of diagnosis. RESULTS: From 2006 to 2012-2013, clinical trial participation increased from 14.8% to 17.9% (P < 0.01).

METHODS: In this study among women 20-44 years of age, 568 cases with breast cancer and 1451 population-based controls were included. They completed a detailed in-person interview, a self-administered food-frequency questionnaire and were measured for anthropometric indices. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) of breast cancer, adjusted for age, study site, race, education, alcohol consumption, oral contraceptive usage, smoking status, and body mass index. RESULTS: There was no association between breast cancer risk and intake of calories, macronutrients, or types of fat. Risk of breast cancer was unrelated to intakes of a variety of food groups, including red meats, dairy, high-fat snacks and desserts, or foods high in animal fat. Increased risk was observed for high intake of a food group composed of sweet items, particularly sodas and desserts. Risk increased linearly with percent of calories from sweets and frequency of sweets intake. Consumption of sweets 9.8 or more times per week compared with <2.8 times per week was associated with an adjusted OR of 1.32 (95% CI = 1.0-1.8). This association did not appear to be due to the high-fat foods or carbonated beverages that comprised the food group. Compared with women reporting one or two meals and snacks per day, reduced risks were noted for women reporting six or more (OR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.4-1.1). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest a modest relationship between intakes of sweet items with risk of in-situ and localized breast cancer in young women.

METHODS: This analysis examines the independent associations and interactions between self-reported neighborhood and psychosocial variables in relation to moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) among adults from a US panel sample. RESULTS: In adjusted models, neighborhood social capital was positively associated with meeting MVPA guidelines. Fewer barriers, greater self-efficacy, and greater autonomous motivation also corresponded with greater odds of meeting MVPA guidelines. An interaction between social capital and autonomous motivation showed that social capital was only associated with MVPA when autonomous motivation was high. Participants who reported both high autonomous motivation and high social capital were most likely to meet MVPA guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Neighborhood social capital, barriers, self-efficacy, and autonomous motivation may be important correlates in promoting adults' PA. Future directions include using objective neighborhood and PA data in similar analyses and investigating associations of neighborhood and psychosocial variables with multiple PA activities.

SETTING: 7 population-based mammography registries in North Carolina; New Mexico; New Hampshire; Vermont; Colorado; Seattle, Washington; and San Francisco, California. PARTICIPANTS: 329 495 women 40 to 89 years of age who had 463 372 screening mammograms from 1996 to 1998; 2223 women received a diagnosis of breast cancer. MEASUREMENTS: Breast density, age, HRT use, rate of breast cancer occurrence, and sensitivity and specificity of screening mammography. RESULTS: Adjusted sensitivity ranged from 62.9% in women with extremely dense breasts to 87.0% in women with almost entirely fatty breasts; adjusted sensitivity increased with age from 68.6% in women 40 to 44 years of age to 83.3% in women 80 to 89 years of age. Adjusted specificity increased from 89.1% in women with extremely dense breasts to 96.9% in women with almost entirely fatty breasts. In women who did not use HRT, adjusted specificity increased from 91.4% in women 40 to 44 years of age to 94.4% in women 80 to 89 years of age. In women who used HRT, adjusted specificity was about 91.7% for all ages. CONCLUSIONS: Mammographic breast density and age are important predictors of the accuracy of screening mammography.

Tob Control 2015;24",2015,Individual and interpersonal triggers to quit smoking in China: a cross-sectional analysis,"AIMS: To determine the most prominent individual and interpersonal triggers to quit smoking in China and their associations with sociodemographic characteristics. METHODS: Data come from Waves 1-3 (2006-2009) of the International Tobacco Control (ITC) China Survey, analysed cross-sectionally as person-waves (N=14,358). Measures included sociodemographic and smoking characteristics. Those who quit between waves (4.3%) were asked about triggers that 'very much' led them to stop smoking, and continuing smokers about triggers that 'very much' made them think about quitting. Triggers covered individual (personal health concerns, cigarette price, smoking restrictions, advertisements, warning labels) and interpersonal factors (family/societal disapproval of smoking, setting an example to children, concerns about secondhand smoke). RESULTS: Over a third of respondents (34.9%) endorsed at least one trigger strongly; quitters were more likely than smokers to mention any trigger. While similar proportions of smokers endorsed individual (24.4%) and interpersonal triggers (24.0%), quitters endorsed more individual (61.1%) than interpersonal (48.3%) triggers. However, the most common triggers (personal health concerns; setting an example to children) were the same, endorsed by two-thirds of quitters and a quarter of smokers, as were the least common triggers (warning labels; cigarette price), endorsed by 1 in 10 quitters and 1 in 20 smokers. Lower dependence among smokers and greater education among all respondents were associated with endorsing any trigger. CONCLUSIONS: Individual rather than interpersonal triggers appear more important for quitters. Major opportunities to motivate quit attempts are missed in China, particularly with regard to taxation and risk communication. Interventions need to focus on more dependent and less-educated smokers.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=25888422,0,0,1,1

Influence of annual interpretive volume on screening mammography performance in the United States. Radiology 2011;259(1):72-84",2011,Influence of annual interpretive volume on screening mammography performance in the United States,"PURPOSE: To examine whether U.S. radiologists' interpretive volume affects their screening mammography performance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Annual interpretive volume measures (total, screening, diagnostic, and screening focus [ratio of screening to diagnostic mammograms]) were collected for 120 radiologists in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) who interpreted 783 965 screening mammograms from 2002 to 2006. Volume measures in 1 year were examined by using multivariate logistic regression relative to screening sensitivity, false-positive rates, and cancer detection rate the next year. BCSC registries and the Statistical Coordinating Center received institutional review board approval for active or passive consenting processes and a Federal Certificate of Confidentiality and other protections for participating women, physicians, and facilities. All procedures were compliant with the terms of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. RESULTS: Mean sensitivity was 85.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 83.7%, 86.6%) and was significantly lower for radiologists with a greater screening focus (P = .023) but did not significantly differ by total (P = .47), screening (P = .33), or diagnostic (P = .23) volume. The mean false-positive rate was 9.1% (95% CI: 8.1%, 10.1%), with rates significantly higher for radiologists who had the lowest total (P = .008) and screening (P = .015) volumes. Radiologists with low diagnostic volume (P = .004 and P = .008) and a greater screening focus (P = .003 and P = .002) had significantly lower false-positive and cancer detection rates, respectively. Median invasive tumor size and proportion of cancers detected at early stages did not vary by volume. CONCLUSION: Increasing minimum interpretive volume requirements in the United States while adding a minimal requirement for diagnostic interpretation could reduce the number of false-positive work-ups without hindering cancer detection.

Since the Food and Drug Administration approved the technology in 1998, it has been disseminated into practice, but its effect on the accuracy of interpretation is unclear. METHODS: We determined the association between the use of computer-aided detection at mammography facilities and the performance of screening mammography from 1998 through 2002 at 43 facilities in three states. We had complete data for 222,135 women (a total of 429,345 mammograms), including 2351 women who received a diagnosis of breast cancer within 1 year after screening. We calculated the specificity, sensitivity, and positive predictive value of screening mammography with and without computer-aided detection, as well as the rates of biopsy and breast-cancer detection and the overall accuracy, measured as the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: Seven facilities (16%) implemented computer-aided detection during the study period. Diagnostic specificity decreased from 90.2% before implementation to 87.2% after implementation (P<0.001), the positive predictive value decreased from 4.1% to 3.2% (P=0.01), and the rate of biopsy increased by 19.7% (P<0.001). The increase in sensitivity from 80.4% before implementation of computer-aided detection to 84.0% after implementation was not significant (P=0.32). The change in the cancer-detection rate (including invasive breast cancers and ductal carcinomas in situ) was not significant (4.15 cases per 1000 screening mammograms before implementation and 4.20 cases after implementation, P=0.90). Analyses of data from all 43 facilities showed that the use of computer-aided detection was associated with significantly lower overall accuracy than was nonuse (area under the ROC curve, 0.871 vs. 0.919; P=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The use of computer-aided detection is associated with reduced accuracy of interpretation of screening mammograms. The increased rate of biopsy with the use of computer-aided detection is not clearly associated with improved detection of invasive breast cancer.

J Med Screen 2012;19(1):35-41",2012,Influence of false-positive mammography results on subsequent screening: do physician recommendations buffer negative effects?,"OBJECTIVE: Cancer screening guidelines often include discussion about the unintended negative consequences of routine screening. This prospective study examined effects of false-positive mammography results on women's adherence to subsequent breast cancer screening and psychological well-being. We also assessed whether barriers to screening exacerbated the effects of false-positive results. METHODS: We conducted secondary analyses of data from telephone interviews and medical claims records for 2406 insured women. The primary outcome was adherence to screening guidelines, defined as adherent (10-14 months), delayed (15-34 months), or no subsequent mammogram on record. RESULTS: About 8% of women reported that their most recent screening mammograms produced false-positive results. In the absence of self-reported advice from their physicians to be screened, women were more likely to have no subsequent mammograms on record if they received false-positive results than if they received normal results (18% vs. 7%, OR = 3.17, 95% CI = 1.30, 7.70). Receipt of false-positive results was not associated with this outcome for women who said their physicians had advised regular screening in the past year (7% vs. 10%, OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.38, 1.45). False-positive results were associated with greater breast cancer worry (P < .01), thinking more about the benefits of screening (P < .001), and belief that abnormal test results do not mean women have cancer (P < .01), regardless of physicians' screening recommendations. CONCLUSION: False-positive mammography results, coupled with reports that women's physicians did not advise regular screening, could lead to non-adherence to future screening.

Presented are a literature review of sexual function measures used in cancer populations and descriptions of the domains found in those measures. By using a consensus-driven approach, an electronic bibliographic search was conducted for articles that were published from 1991 to 2007, and 486 articles were identified for in-depth review. In total, 257 articles reported the administration of a psychometrically evaluated sexual function measure to individuals who were diagnosed with cancer. Apart from the University of California-Los Angeles Prostate Cancer Index, the International Index of Erectile Function, and the Female Sexual Function Index, the 31 identified measures have not been tested widely in cancer populations. Most measures were multidimensional and included domains related to the sexual response cycle and to general sexual satisfaction. The current review supports the need for a flexible, psychometrically robust measure of sexual function for use in oncology settings and strongly justifies the development of the PROMIS-Sexual Function instrument.

METHODS: In a large U.S. cohort study, intakes of 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), and 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (DiMeIQx) and a meat-derived mutagenicity (MDM) index were assessed using a cooking method questionnaire administered in 1996. Until 2010, 2,770 prostate cancer cases were observed among 26,030 participants. RESULTS: Intake of PhIP from red meat was statistically significantly associated with total prostate cancer risk (top vs. bottom quintile HR, 1.18; 95% confidence intervals; CI, 1.03-1.35), but not other HCAs (MeIQx, 1.12; 0.98-1.27, PhIP from white meat, 1.08; 0.95-1.22, DiMeIQx, 1.09; 0.97-1.21) or MDM (1.13; 1.00-1.28).

Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis 2015;25(11):1016-1024",2015,Intake of polyunsaturated fat in relation to mortality among statin users and non-users in the Southern Community Cohort Study,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), especially the n3-series, may protect against cardiovascular disease (CVD), but recent randomized studies have failed to demonstrate these benefits. One of the prevailing hypotheses is that PUFA intake may not confer benefits beyond those provided by statins, but studies comparing statin users to non-users with regard to effects of PUFA are lacking. METHODS AND RESULTS: Black and white men and women (n = 69,559) in the Southern Community Cohort Study were studied. Cox regression models adjusting for age, sex, race, BMI, recruitment site, education, income, smoking, diabetes, and dietary variables were used. RESULTS: At baseline the mean +/- SD age was 52 +/- 9 years, 60% of participants were women, 54% had hypertension and 16% used statins. We observed modest inverse associations between n3-PUFA and n6-PUFA intake with mortality among non-statin users but not among statin users. In adjusted analyses, the HRs (95% CIs) for all-cause mortality (6,396 deaths over a median of 6.4 years) comparing the highest to the lowest quintile were 0.90 (0.82-1.00) for n3-PUFA and 0.80 (0.70-0.92) for n6-PUFA among non-statin users, whereas they were 1.06 (0.87-1.28) and 0.96 (0.78-1.19) for n3-PUFA and n6-PUFA, respectively, among statin users. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest potential benefits of PUFA consumption on mortality which are only apparent in the absence of statin therapy. It seems prudent to consider the potential benefit of PUFA consumption in the primary prevention of CVD among patients who are not candidates for statin therapy but are at increased risk for CVD and mortality.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26298428,0,1,0,0

To identify new genes with too small an effect to be detected individually but which collectively influence melanoma risk and/or show interactive effects, we used a two-step analysis strategy including pathway analysis of genome-wide SNP data, in a first step, and epistasis analysis within significant pathways, in a second step. Pathway analysis, using the gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) approach and the gene ontology (GO) database, was applied to the outcomes of MELARISK (3,976 subjects) and MDACC (2,827 subjects) GWASs. Cross-gene SNP-SNP interaction analysis within melanoma-associated GOs was performed using the INTERSNP software. Five GO categories were significantly enriched in genes associated with melanoma (false discovery rate </= 5% in both studies): response to light stimulus, regulation of mitotic cell cycle, induction of programmed cell death, cytokine activity and oxidative phosphorylation. Epistasis analysis, within each of the five significant GOs, showed significant evidence for interaction for one SNP pair at TERF1 and AFAP1L2 loci (pmeta-int = 2.0 x 10(-7) , which met both the pathway and overall multiple-testing corrected thresholds that are equal to 9.8 x 10(-7) and 2.0 x 10(-7) , respectively) and suggestive evidence for another pair involving correlated SNPs at the same loci (pmeta-int = 3.6 x 10(-6) ). This interaction has important biological relevance given the key role of TERF1 in telomere biology and the reported physical interaction between TERF1 and AFAP1L2 proteins.

RESULTS: We found that the rs13387042-2q35(G/A) SNP was associated with breast cancer risk only among postmenopausal women who never used hormone therapy [per A allele OR: 0.94 (95% confidence intervals, 0.74-1.20), 1.20 (0.94-1.53), and 1.49 (1.28-1.75) for current, former, and never hormone therapy users, respectively, Pinteraction 0.002] and premenopausal women who breastfed >12 months [OR: 1.01 (0.72-1.42), 1.19 (0.98-1.45), and 1.69 (1.26-2.26) for never, <12 months, and >12 months breastfeeding, respectively, Pinteraction 0.014]. CONCLUSIONS: The correlation between genetic ancestry, hormone replacement therapy use, and breastfeeding behavior partially explained a previously reported interaction between a breast cancer risk variant and genetic ancestry in Hispanic women. IMPACT: These results highlight the importance of understanding the interplay between genetic ancestry, genetics, and nongenetic risk factors and their contribution to breast cancer risk.

METHODS: We imputed Immunochip data on HLA amino acids and classical alleles from 3 case-control studies (the Swedish Epidemiological Investigation of Rheumatoid Arthritis [EIRA] study [1,654 cases and 1,934 controls], the Nurses' Health Study [NHS] [229 cases and 360 controls], and the Korean RA Cohort Study [1,390 cases and 735 controls]). We examined the interaction effects of heavy smoking (>10 pack-years) and the genetic risk score (GRS) of multiple RA-associated amino acid positions (positions 11, 13, 71, and 74 in HLA-DRbeta1, position 9 in HLA-B, and position 9 in HLA-DPbeta1), as well as the interaction effects of heavy smoking and the GRS of HLA-DRbeta1 4-amino acid haplotypes (assessed via attributable proportion due to interaction [AP] using the additive interaction model). RESULTS: Heavy smoking and all investigated HLA amino acid positions and haplotypes were associated with RA susceptibility in the 3 populations. In the interaction analysis, we found a significant deviation from the expected additive joint effect between heavy smoking and the HLA-DRbeta1 4-amino acid haplotype (AP 0.416, 0.467, and 0.796, in the EIRA, NHS, and Korean studies, respectively). We further identified the key interacting variants as being located at HLA-DRbeta1 amino acid positions 11 and 13 but not at any of the other RA risk-associated amino acid positions. For residues in positions 11 and 13, there were similar patterns between RA risk effects and interaction effects. CONCLUSION: Our findings of significant gene-environment interaction effects indicate that a physical interaction between citrullinated autoantigens produced by smoking and HLA-DR molecules is characterized by the HLA-DRbeta1 4-amino acid haplotype, primarily by positions 11 and 13.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26098791,0,1,0,1

Interactions between high- and low-risk HPV types reduce the risk of squamous cervical cancer. J Natl Cancer Inst 2015;107(10)",2015,Interactions between high- and low-risk HPV types reduce the risk of squamous cervical cancer,"BACKGROUND: The clinical significance of co-infections with high-risk (HR) and low-risk (LR) human papillomavirus (HPV) in the etiology of cervical cancer is debated, as prospective evidence on this issue is limited. However, the question is of increasing relevance in relation to HPV-based cancer prevention. METHODS: In two population-based nested case-control studies among women participating in cervical screening with baseline normal smears, we collected 4659 smears from women who later developed cancer in situ (CIS; n = 524) or squamous cervical cancer (SCC; n = 378) and individually matched control subjects who remained free of disease during study follow-up. The median follow-up until diagnosis was 6.4 to 7.8 years. All smears were tested for HPV. We used conditional logistic regression models with two-way interaction terms to estimate relative risks (RRs) for CIS and SCC, respectively. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Compared with women who were infected with HRHPV only, women who were also infected with LRHPV had a lower risk for SCC (RR = 0.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.04 to 0.99, P = .049). This interaction was not shown for CIS (RR = 1.1, 95% CI = 0.4 to 3.6). Women who were positive for both HRHPV and LRHPV had, on average, a 4.8 year longer time to diagnosis of SCC than women who were positive for HRHPV only (P = .006). Results were highly robust in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: Co-infection with LRHPV is associated with a lower risk of future invasive disease and longer time to diagnosis than infection with HRHPV alone. We propose that co-infection with LRHPV interferes with the rate of progression to invasive cervical cancer.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Cervix, Female Genital Organs",Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26160881,0,1,0,0

Compared to NL White women with high-education/high-nSES, higher all-cause mortality was observed among NL White women with high-education/low-nSES [hazard ratio (HR) (95 % confidence interval) 1.24 (1.08-1.43)], and African American women with low-nSES, regardless of education [high education HR 1.24 (1.03-1.49); low-education HR 1.19 (0.99-1.44)].

MR images of four subjects with different prostate sizes and pelvic tissue compositions, including fatty tissue and venous plexus, were analyzed. The MR images acquired using endorectal coil provided a realistic geometry of deformed prostate that resembled the anatomy in the presence of ECB. A single slice with the largest two-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional area of the prostate gland was selected for analysis. The rectal wall, prostate gland, peri-rectal fatty tissue, peri-prostatic fatty tissue, peri-prostatic venous plexus, and urinary bladder were manually segmented. Pennes' bioheat thermal model was used to simulate the temperature distribution dynamics, by using an in-house finite element mesh based solver written in MATLAB. The results showed that prostate size and periprostatic venous plexus were two major factors affecting ECB cooling efficiency. For cases with negligible amount of venous plexus and small prostate, the average temperature in the prostate and neurovascular bundles could be cooled down to 25 degrees C within 30 min. For cases with abundant venous plexus and large prostate, the temperature could not reach 25 degrees C at the end of 3 h cooling. Large prostate made the cooling difficult to propagate through. The impact of fatty tissue on cooling effect was small. The filling of bladder with warm urine during the ECB cooling procedure did not affect the temperature in the prostate or NVB. In addition to the 2D simulation, in one case a 3D pelvic model was constructed for volumetric simulation. It was found that the 2D slice with the largest cross-sectional area of prostate had the most abundant venous plexus, and was the most difficult slice to cool, thus it may provide a conservative prediction of the cooling effect. This feasibility study demonstrated that the simulation tool could potentially be used for adjusting the setting of ECB for individual patients during hypothermic radical prostatectomy. Further studies using MR thermometry are required to validate the in silico results obtained using simulation.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Prostate, Male Genital Organs",Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26198131,0,1,0,0

A component of the conference was presentation of a psychometric and content analysis of a secondary dataset. OBJECTIVES: A thorough psychometric and content analysis was conducted of two primary domains within a cancer health-related quality of life (HRQOL) dataset. RESEARCH DESIGN: HRQOL scales were evaluated using factor analysis for categorical data, IRT modeling, and differential item functioning analyses. In addition, computerized adaptive administration of HRQOL item banks was simulated, and various IRT models were applied and compared. SUBJECTS: The original data were collected as part of the NCI-funded Quality of Life Evaluation in Oncology (Q-Score) Project. A total of 1,714 patients with cancer or HIV/AIDS were recruited from 5 clinical sites. MEASURES: Items from 4 HRQOL instruments were evaluated: Cancer Rehabilitation Evaluation System-Short Form, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy and Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form Health Survey. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Four lessons learned from the project are discussed: the importance of good developmental item banks, the ambiguity of model fit results, the limits of our knowledge regarding the practical implications of model misfit, and the importance in the measurement of HRQOL of construct definition. With respect to these lessons, areas for future research are suggested. The feasibility of developing item banks for broad definitions of health is discussed.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,"Outcomes Research, Applied Research Program",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=17351824,0,1,0,0

In the current study, the authors explored whether detection by mammography was associated with greater use of guideline-consistent breast cancer treatment among patients with recently diagnosed breast cancer in the United States. METHODS: The authors evaluated the association between mode of breast cancer detection (mammography vs other) and use of guideline-consistent treatment in 1006 women aged > or =40 years who were diagnosed in 2000. These patients were sampled from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program as part of the Patterns of Care studies. The analyses controlled for the potential confounders of clinical, demographic, and health system characteristics in multivariate logistic regression models. RESULTS: Breast cancer patients who were diagnosed by mammography were more likely to be aged > or =55 years, to have lower stage disease, and to be treated in larger hospitals than patients who were diagnosed by other methods (P < .05).

A comparative analysis of stage-specific surveillance strategies,"OBJECTIVE: To guide resource utilization, we aimed to determine the impact of routine surveillance imaging for the detection of melanoma recurrences amenable to surgical resection with curative intent. BACKGROUND: The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for melanoma surveillance are largely consensus based. METHODS: Using single-institution, patient-level data (n = 1600), transition probabilities were calculated for a Markov model simulating the natural history of patients with stage I-III melanoma. As a base estimate, imaging was assumed to detect regional and distant recurrences of which 80% and 20% could be surgically treated with curative intent, respectively. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for all point estimates. For each disease stage, we calculated the number of surgically treatable regional or distant recurrence detected during 5 years per 10,000 patients undergoing computed tomography (CT) or positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scans at 6- or 12-month intervals. The associated positive and negative predictive values and life expectancy were also calculated and compared with clinical examination alone. RESULTS: At 5-year follow-up, CT or PET/CT at 6-month intervals detected surgically treatable regional or distant recurrence in 6.4% of patients with stage I, 18.5% of stage II, and 33.1% of stage III disease; 12-month intervals decreased the rates to 3.0%, 7.9%, and 13.0%, respectively. The high false-positive rates of CT (20%) and PET/CT (9%) resulted in overall low positive predictive values. However, both CT and PET/CT effectively predicted absence of disease. Life-expectancy gains were minimal (</= 2 months) for all groups. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of routine surveillance imaging for detecting treatable melanoma recurrences is limited. Even in patients with stage III disease, only minimal gains in life expectancy were achieved.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Melanoma, Skin",Healthcare Delivery Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=24096759,0,1,0,0

J Cancer Surviv 2014;8(2):156-166",2014,"It's who you know: patient-sharing, quality, and costs of cancer survivorship care","PURPOSE: Cancer survivors frequently receive care from a large number of physicians, creating challenges for coordination. We sought to explore whether cancer survivors whose providers have more patients in common (e.g., shared patients) tend to have higher quality and lower cost care. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 8,661 patients diagnosed with loco-regional breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer. We examined survivorship care from days 366 to 1,095 following their cancer diagnosis. Our primary independent variable was ""care density,"" a novel metric of the extent to which a patient's providers share patients with one another. Our outcome measures were health care utilization, quality metrics, and costs. RESULTS: In adjusted analyses, we found that patients with high care density--indicating high levels of patient-sharing among their providers--had significantly lower rates of hospitalization (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.75-1.00) and higher odds of an eye examination for diabetes (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.03-1.66) compared to patients with low care density. High care density was not associated with emergency department visits, avoidable outcomes, lipid profile following an angina diagnosis, or odds of glycosylated hemoglobin testing for diabetes. Patients with high care density had significantly lower total costs of care over 24 months (beta coefficient -$2,116, 95% CI -$3,107 to -$1,125) along with lower inpatient and outpatient costs. CONCLUSION: Cancer survivors treated by physicians who share more patients with one another tend to have some higher aspects of quality and lower cost care.

This study assesses adult women's knowledge of the need to continue cervical cancer screening after HPV vaccination, describes Pap test intentions of vaccinated young adult women, and evaluates whether knowledge and intentions differ across groups at greatest risk for cervical cancer. METHODS: Data were from the 2008 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) and the 2008 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), which initiated data collection approximately 18 months after the first FDA approval of an HPV vaccine. We calculated associations between independent variables and the outcomes using chi-square tests. RESULTS: Of 1586 female HINTS respondents ages 18 through 74, 95.6% knew that HPV-vaccinated women should continue to receive Pap tests. This knowledge did not vary significantly by race/ethnicity, education, income, or healthcare access. Among 1101 female NHIS respondents ages 18-26 who had ever received a Pap test, the proportion (12.7%; n=139) who reported receipt of the HPV vaccine were more likely than those not vaccinated to plan to receive a Pap test within three years (98.1% vs. 92.5%, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: US adult women possess high knowledge and intention to participate in Pap testing after HPV vaccination.

We evaluate whether clinical encounters offer such opportunities. METHODS: Within seven health care plans, we identified 1298 women aged more than 50 years with early (<3 cm), late-stage (> or = 3 cm), or metastatic invasive breast cancer diagnosed during 1995-1999, whose first screening mammogram 13-36 months prior to the diagnosis (index) was negative. We audited all care occurring in the health plans up to 36 months prior to the cancer diagnoses. Ordinal logistic regression compared the frequency of events by disease category. We hypothesized that during the 13-36 months prior to diagnosis, women with late-stage or metastatic breast cancer would have more symptoms and be more likely to have breast-related clinical visits but have less breast screening (clinical breast examination [CBE] or mammography) than women with early-stage disease, thereby indicating clinical opportunities for earlier detection. RESULTS: We found no differences in demographic characteristics across breast cancer stage among the 1298 women. Both before and after the negative index mammogram but during the 13-36 months prior to diagnosis, few women had breast symptoms (5% before index, 8% after), but many sought breast care (86% before index, 90% after) and screening CBE (62% before index, 43% after). Only the occurrence of screening CBE (odds ratio [OR] = 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.56 to 0.95) or screening mammograms (OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.57 to 0.97) after the negative index mammogram reduced odds of more severe disease at diagnosis.

Ann Behav Med 2017;51(2):214-225",2017,Lay awareness of the relationship between age and cancer risk,"BACKGROUND: Cross-sectional studies suggest many people are unaware that cancer risk increases with age, but this misbelief has rarely been studied prospectively, nor are its moderators known. PURPOSE: To assess whether people recognize that cancer risk increases with age and whether beliefs differ according to gender, education, smoking status, and family history of cancer. METHODS: First, items from the cross-sectional Health Information National Trends Survey (n = 2069) were analyzed to examine the association of age and perceived cancer risk. Second, the prospective National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States (n = 3896) was used to assess whether perceived cancer risk changes over a decade. Third, beliefs about the age at which cancer occurs were analyzed using the US Awareness and Beliefs about Cancer survey (n = 1080). As a comparator, perceived risk of heart disease was also examined. RESULTS: Cross-sectionally, older age was associated with lower perceived cancer risk but higher perceived heart disease risk. Prospectively, perceived cancer risk remained stable, whereas perceived heart attack risk increased. Seventy percent of participants reported a belief that cancer is equally likely to affect people of any age. Across three surveys, women and former smokers/smokers who recently quit tended to misunderstand the relationship between age and cancer risk and also expressed relatively higher perceived cancer risk overall. CONCLUSIONS: Data from three national surveys indicated that people are unaware that age is a risk factor for cancer. Moreover, those who were least aware perceived the highest risk of cancer regardless of age.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27752991,0,1,0,0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The subjects were women 30 years old and older without breast implants or previous breast cancer who received notice of a probably benign finding on a bilateral screening mammogram between January 1, 1996, and June 30, 1999, in a community-based practice. From 82,898 mammograms, we identified 129 breast lesions designated probably benign that progressed to malignancy within 3 years of an index examination (cases) and matched them to 129 lesions designated probably benign that did not progress to malignancy within 3 years (controls). A breast imaging specialist blinded to case-control status interpreted all examinations and recorded detailed lesion descriptors according to the BI-RADS lexicon. RESULTS: Case lesions were more likely in patients who were older, postmenopausal, or had a strong family history of breast cancer or previous biopsy. The lesions were more likely masses with obscured, indistinct, or spiculated margins compared with control lesions (84.6% vs 66%, p = 0.03). Case lesions were more likely calcifications (29.5% vs 17.8%, p = 0.03). No cases were encountered among calcifications considered typically benign in the BI-RADS lexicon (vascular or coarse), and no controls were encountered among calcifications considered suspicious or highly suggestive of malignancy in the BI-RADS lexicon (amorphous, pleomorphic, branching, and fine linear) (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: In community practice, patient and lesion mammographic characteristics can be predictive of the likelihood of a subsequent cancer diagnosis of mammographic lesions designated as probably benign.

Cohort studies with prediagnostic specimens (eg, blood specimens collected prior to development of clinical symptoms) and clinical data have recently been used to assess the validity of some early detection biomarkers. With this background, the Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS) and the Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) held a joint workshop in August 2013. The goal was to advance early detection cancer research by considering how the infrastructure of cohort studies that already exist or are being developed might be leveraged to include appropriate blood specimens, including prediagnostic specimens, ideally collected at periodic intervals, along with clinical data about symptom status and cancer diagnosis. Three overarching recommendations emerged from the discussions: 1) facilitate sharing of existing specimens and data, 2) encourage collaboration among scientists developing biomarkers and those conducting observational cohort studies or managing healthcare systems with cohorts followed over time, and 3) conduct pilot projects that identify and address key logistic and feasibility issues regarding how appropriate specimens and clinical data might be collected at reasonable effort and cost within existing or future cohorts.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Healthcare Delivery Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=25688116,0,1,0,0

Menopause 2015;22(10):1076-1083",2015,Life course exposure to smoke and early menopause and menopausal transition,"OBJECTIVE: Early age at menopause is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, osteoporosis, and all-cause mortality. Cigarette smoke exposure in adulthood is an established risk factor for earlier age at natural menopause and may be related to age at the menopausal transition. Using data from two US birth cohorts, we examined the association between smoke exposure at various stages of the life course (prenatal exposure, childhood exposure to parental smoking, and adult smoke exposure) and menopause status in 1,001 women aged 39 to 49 years at follow-up. METHODS: We used logistic regression analysis (adjusting for age at follow-up) to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) relating smoke exposure to natural menopause and the menopausal transition. RESULTS: The magnitudes of the associations for natural menopause were similar but not statistically significant after adjustment for confounders among (i) women with prenatal smoke exposure who did not smoke on adult follow-up (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 0.8-9.4) and (ii) current adult smokers who were not exposed prenatally (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 0.9-9.0). Women who had been exposed to prenatal smoke and were current smokers had three times the risk of experiencing earlier natural menopause (adjusted OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.1-10.3) compared with women without smoke exposure in either period. Only current smoking of long duration (>26 y) was associated with the timing of the menopausal transition. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that exposure to smoke both prenatally and around the time of menopause accelerates ovarian aging.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=25803667,0,1,0,1

Only a few previous studies have examined associations between lifestyle factors and chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome, of which most were limited by the cross-sectional study design and lack of control for possible confounders. To address these limitations we performed a cohort study of major lifestyle factors (obesity, smoking and hypertension) and chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome risk in the HPFS (Health Professionals Follow-up Study), a large ongoing cohort of United States based male health professionals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The HPFS includes 51,529 men who were 40 to 75 years old at baseline in 1986. At enrollment and every 2 years thereafter participants have completed questionnaires on lifestyle and health conditions. In 2008 participants completed an additional set of questions on recent chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome pain symptoms modified from the NIH (National Institutes of Health)-CPSI (Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index) as well as questions on approximate date of symptom onset. The 653 participants with NIH-CPSI pain scores 8 or greater who first experienced symptoms after 1986 were considered incident chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome cases and the 19,138 who completed chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome questions but did not report chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome related pain were considered noncases. RESULTS: No associations were observed for baseline body mass index, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, cigarette smoking and hypertension with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome risk (each OR </=1.34). CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort study none of the lifestyle factors examined was associated with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome risk. As the etiology of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome remains unknown, additional prospective studies are needed to elucidate modifiable risk factors for this common condition.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26070893,0,1,0,0

Methods: Data were drawn from a previous study and include LMI, demographics, mood, and smoking cessation outcomes. We evaluated the relationship between multiple LMIs and smoking cessation at 7 months post-intervention, and depression in combination with another LMI. Results: At 7 months, the adjusted odds of cessation for those with one LMI, including depression, were 0.74 (p = .102), and for those with 2+ LMIs, 0.69 (p = .037), both in comparison with participants who reported no history of LMI. Among those with 2+ LMIs, the adjusted odds of cessation for those with a depression diagnosis were 0.34 (p = .007) compared to those whose multiple LMIs did not include depression. Conclusions: Among smokers seeking cessation treatment, those who had 2+ LMIs were at greater risk of relapse, an effect particularly marked in smokers with depression. This study adds to the literature examining the potential impact of LMI on smokers' ability to quit by considering the potential impact of 2+ LMIs and highlights the potential impact of depression as a risk factor for continued smoking.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=29973314,0,0,0,1

Dysregulation of lncRNAs may be involved in many pathogenic processes including cancer. Recently, we found an intergenic lncRNA, LINC00472, whose expression was correlated with breast cancer progression and patient survival. Our findings were consistent across multiple clinical datasets and supported by results from in vitro experiments. To evaluate further the role of LINC00472 in breast cancer, we used various online databases to investigate possible mechanisms that might affect LINC00472 expression in breast cancer. We also analyzed associations of LINC00472 with estrogen receptor, tumor grade, and molecular subtypes in additional online datasets generated by microarray platforms different from the one we investigated previously. We found that LINC00472 expression in breast cancer was regulated more possibly by promoter methylation than by the alteration of gene copy number. Analysis of additional datasets confirmed our previous findings of high expression of LINC00472 associated with ER-positive and low-grade tumors and favorable molecular subtypes. Finally, in nine datasets, we examined the association of LINC00472 expression with disease-free survival in patients with grade 2 tumors. Meta-analysis of the datasets showed that LINC00472 expression in breast tumors predicted the recurrence of breast cancer in patients with grade 2 tumors. In summary, our analyses confirm that LINC00472 is functionally a tumor suppressor, and that assessing its expression in breast tumors may have clinical implications in breast cancer management.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Breast,Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26564482,0,1,0,0

Cancer patients, a highly diverse population, communicate with their clinical care team in diverse ways over the course of their care trajectory. Whether that communication happens and how effective it is may relate to a variety of factors including the type of cancer and the patient's position on the cancer care continuum. Yet, many of the routine needs of cancer patients after initial cancer treatment are often not addressed adequately. Our goal is to identify areas of strength and areas for improvement in cancer communication by investigating real-time cancer consultations in a cross section of patient-clinician interactions at diverse study sites.

METHOD: Previous studies of bidirectional influence in couples' cortisol levels (Liu, Rovine, Klein, & Almeida, 2013; Papp, Pendry, Simon, & Adam, 2013; Saxbe & Repetti, 2010) found significant covariation in couples' daily cortisol levels over several days, but no studies have tested whether cortisol response similarity increases over time using a longitudinal design. In the present study, 183 opposite sex couples (366 participants) engaged in a conflict discussion in a laboratory visit about 6 months after their marriage, and again about 2 years into the marriage. At each visit, spouses provided saliva samples that indexed cortisol levels before, during, and after the discussion. This multimeasure procedure enabled modeling of spouses' cortisol trajectories around the conflict discussion. RESULTS: Findings showed significant convergence in couples' cortisol trajectories across the early years of marriage; couples showed significantly greater similarity in cortisol trajectories around the conflict discussion as their relationship matured. Cohabitation length predicted stronger convergence in cortisol slopes prior to the conflict discussion. Couples' relationship dissatisfaction was associated with a greater degree of convergence in spouses' acute cortisol levels during the conflict discussion. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that spouses increasingly shape each other's cortisol responses as their relationship matures. Findings also indicated that increased similarity in acute cortisol levels during conflict may be associated with poorer relationship functioning.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26010721,0,1,0,1

METHODS: From January 1993 to December 2003, data that included American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) breast density categories (1-4 in order of increasing density) were collected prospectively on 301,955 women aged 30 and older who were not using postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy and underwent at least two screening mammography examinations; 2639 of the women were diagnosed with breast cancer within 1 year of the last examination. Women's first and last BI-RADS breast density (average 3.2 years apart) and logistic regression were used to model the odds of having invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ diagnosed within 12 months of the last examination by change in BI-RADS category. Rates of breast cancer adjusted for age, mammography registry, and time between screening examinations were estimated from this model. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: The rate (breast cancers per 1000 women) of breast cancer was higher if BI-RADS breast density category increased from 1 to 2 (5.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.7 to 6.9) or 1 to 3 (9.9, 95% CI = 6.4 to 15.5) compared to when it remained at BI-RADS density of 1 (3.0, 95% CI = 2.3 to 3.9; P<.001 for trend). Similar and statistically significant trends between increased or decreased density and increased or decreased risk of breast cancer, respectively, were observed for women whose breast density category was initially 2 or 3 and changed categories. BI-RADS density of 4 on the first examination was associated with a high rate of breast cancer (range 9.1-13.4) that remained high even if breast density decreased. CONCLUSION: An increase in BI-RADS breast density category within 3 years may be associated with an increase in breast cancer risk and a decrease in density category with a decrease in risk compared to breast cancer risk in women in whom breast density category remains unchanged. Two longitudinal measures of BI-RADS breast density may better predict a woman's risk of breast cancer than a single measure.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Breast,"Office of the Associate Director, Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Progra, Surveillance Research Program, Applied Research Program",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=17341730,0,1,0,0

Limited evidence is available about long-term incident cirrhosis in this population. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to estimate the overall and sex-specific incidence of cirrhosis among HCV-seropositive survivors of pediatric cancer. STUDY DESIGN: We identified 113HCV-seropositive pediatric cancer patients treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital between 1962 and 1997, who survived >/=5 years post-diagnosis, and were followed through 2014. Our outcome was cirrhosis determined by liver biopsy or diagnostic imaging. We used a competing-risk framework to estimate the overall and sex-specific cumulative incidence and 95% confidence limits (CL) of cirrhosis at 10-year follow-up intervals. RESULTS: The median duration of follow-up was 30 years (interquartile range=28-36) post-cancer diagnosis. Cumulative incidence of cirrhosis increased at each 10-year interval from 0% after 10 years to 13% after 40 years (Ptrend<0.001). The median age at diagnosis of cirrhosis was 30 years (interquartile range=24-38). We observed a linear trend in incidence for males (Ptrend<0.001), with a cumulative incidence of 18% (95% CL: 6.1%, 34%) after 40 years. The cumulative incidence for females was 6.5% (95% CL: 0.42%, 26%) after 40 years, but we did not observe a linear trend (Ptrend=0.99).

Although red and processed meats are generally considered to have adverse cardiovascular consequences, seafood is believed to be protective and poultry's effect is controversial. METHODS: We prospectively examined the independent association of long-term intake of animal flesh with incident hypertension in three longitudinal cohort studies of nonhypertensive individuals: Nurses' Health Study (NHS, n = 62 273 women), Nurses' Health Study II (NHS II, n = 88 831 women), and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS, n = 37 414 men). We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression to study the associations of different types of animal flesh with the risk of developing hypertension while controlling for other hypertension risk factors. We then used fixed-effects meta-analysis to derive pooled estimates of effect. RESULTS: Compared with participants whose consumption was less than 1 serving/month, the pooled hazard ratios among those whose intake was at least 1 serving/day were 1.30 (95% confidence interval 1.23-1.39) for total meat (a combination of processed and unprocessed red meat), 1.22 (1.12-1.34) for poultry, and 1.05 (0.98-1.13) for seafood. Seafood was associated with an increased risk of hypertension in HPFS and NHS II, but not NHS. Consumption of any animal flesh at least 1 serving/day was associated with an increased hypertension risk [pooled hazard ratio = 1.30 (1.16-1.47)]. CONCLUSION: Long-term intake of meat and poultry were associated with increased risk of hypertension. In contrast to our hypothesis, we found a weak but significant trend toward an increased risk of hypertension with increasing seafood consumption.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26237562,0,1,0,0

DESIGN: Retrospective data analysis from a subcohort of participants in the Polyp Prevention Trial (PPT), a 4-year, multisite, randomized, controlled dietary intervention trial. Intervention consisted of educational material and counseling sessions supporting a low-fat, high-fiber diet. Baseline and annual demographics, behavioral characteristics, energy intake (EI) based on self-reported 4-day food records, and height and weight of participants were collected at baseline and annually. Basal metabolic rate (BMR) was estimated (using the Schofield equation) to calculate EI/BMR. SUBJECTS: Of the 443 participants (302 male, 141 female) at baseline, 195 (43.3%) were younger than 60 years, and 394 (91%) were white. At Year 4, 383 participants remained: 186 (122 men, 64 women) in the intervention group, and 197 (133 men, 64 women) in the control group. STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Using either paired t tests or analysis of variance, the differences between the means for EI, weight, and EI/BMR were compared at baseline, Year 1, and Year 4 for the participants who remained at Year 4. The Goldberg EI/BMR cutoff value of 1.06 (for plausible EI) identified participants who reported low EI. Linear regression was used to quantify the association of various risk factors to EI/BMR and for multivariate analyses within groups. chi(2) contingency table analysis quantified differences of low energy reporting within groups.

These older, high-risk smokers differ from participants in past clinical trials of behavioral and pharmacologic interventions for tobacco dependence. There is a gap in knowledge about how best to design systems to extend reach and treatments to maximize smoking cessation in the context of lung cancer screening. Eight clinical trials, seven funded by the National Cancer Institute and one by the Veterans Health Administration, address this gap and form the SCALE (Smoking Cessation within the Context of Lung Cancer Screening) collaboration. This paper describes methodological issues related to the design of these clinical trials: clinical workflow, participant eligibility criteria, screening indication (baseline or annual repeat screen), assessment content, interest in stopping smoking, and treatment delivery method and dose, all of which will affect tobacco treatment outcomes. Tobacco interventions consider the teachable moment offered by lung cancer screening, how to incorporate positive and negative screening results, and coordination of smoking cessation treatment with clinical events associated with lung cancer screening. Unique data elements, such as perceived risk of lung cancer and costs of tobacco treatment, are of interest. Lung cancer screening presents a new and promising opportunity to reduce morbidity and mortality resulting from lung cancer that can be amplified by effective smoking cessation treatment.

No recent national survey of health care professionals has focused on lung cancer screening. In this study, we examined the lung cancer screening practices of US primary care physicians and characteristics of those who order lung cancer screening tests. METHODS: We conducted a nationally representative survey of practicing primary care physicians in 2006-2007. Mailed questionnaires assessed the physicians' knowledge of lung cancer screening guidelines, beliefs about the effectiveness of screening tests, and ordering of screening chest radiograph, low-dose spiral computed tomography, or sputum cytology in the past 12 months. Clinical vignettes were used to assess the physicians' intentions to screen asymptomatic 50-year-old patients with varying smoking histories for lung cancer. RESULTS: A total of 962 family physicians, general practitioners, and general internists completed questionnaires (cooperation rate = 76.8%). Overall, 38% had ordered no lung cancer screening tests; 55% had ordered chest radiograph, 22% low-dose spiral computed tomography, and less than 5% sputum cytology. In multivariate modeling, physicians were more likely to have ordered lung cancer screening tests if they believed that expert groups recommend lung cancer screening or that screening tests are effective; if they would recommend screening for asymptomatic patients, including patients without substantial smoking exposure; and if their patients had asked them about screening.

A total of 369 families with at least one carrier of a mutation in a MMR gene (133 MLH1, 174 MSH2, 35 MSH6 and 27 PMS2) were ascertained via population cancer registries or via family cancer clinics in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and USA.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Radiologists interpreting screening mammography examinations completed a mailed survey consisting of questions pertaining to demographic and clinical practice characteristics, as well as 2 vignettes describing different risk profiles of women. Respondents were asked to estimate the probability of a breast cancer diagnosis in the next 5 years for each vignette. Vignette responses were plotted against mean recall rates in actual clinical practice. RESULTS: The survey was returned by 77% of eligible radiologists. Ninety-three percent of radiologists overestimated risk in the vignette involving a 70-year-old woman; 96% overestimated risk in the vignette involving a 41-year-old woman. Radiologists who more accurately estimated breast cancer risk were younger, worked full-time, were affiliated with an academic medical center, had fellowship training, had fewer than 10 years experience interpreting mammograms, and worked more than 40% of the time in breast imaging. However, only age was statistically significant. No association was found between radiologists' risk estimate and their recall rate.

Mammographic density, a secondary outcome, is reported here. METHODS: The ALPHA Trial was a parallel group randomized controlled trial conducted between May 2003 and July 2007. Postmenopausal, sedentary women ages 50 to 74 years (n = 320) were evenly randomized to aerobic exercise (45 minutes, 5 days per week) or control (usual life-style) for 1 year. Dense fibroglandular tissue and nondense fatty tissue were measured from mammograms at baseline and 1 year using computer-assisted thresholding software for area measurements and a new technique that relies on the calibration of mammography units with a tissue-equivalent phantom for volumetric measurements. RESULTS: Nondense volume decreased in the exercise group relative to the control group (difference between groups = -38.5 cm(3); 95% confidence interval, -61.6 to 15.4; P = 0.001). Changes in total body fat accounted for this decrease. Changes in dense area and dense volume, measures that have previously been associated with breast cancer risk, were not significantly different between the groups (P > or = 0.26).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study received institutional review board approval and was HIPAA compliant. A total of 117,136 diagnostic mammograms that were interpreted by 107 radiologists between 2002 and 2006 in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium were included. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the adjusted effect on sensitivity and the rates of false-positive findings and cancer detection of four volume measures: annual diagnostic volume, screening volume, total volume, and diagnostic focus (percentage of total volume that is diagnostic). Analyses were stratified by the indication for imaging: additional imaging after screening mammography or evaluation of a breast concern or problem. RESULTS: Diagnostic volume was associated with sensitivity; the odds of a true-positive finding rose until a diagnostic volume of 1000 mammograms was reached; thereafter, they either leveled off (P < .001 for additional imaging) or decreased (P = .049 for breast concerns or problems) with further volume increases. Diagnostic focus was associated with false-positive rate; the odds of a false-positive finding increased until a diagnostic focus of 20% was reached and decreased thereafter (P < .024 for additional imaging and P < .001 for breast concerns or problems with no self-reported lump). Neither total volume nor screening volume was consistently associated with diagnostic performance. CONCLUSION: Interpretive volume and diagnostic performance have complex multifaceted relationships.

Understanding sources of facility variation could become a foundation for improving interpretive performance. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study conducted between 1996 and 2002, we surveyed 53 facilities to evaluate associations between facility structure, interpretive process characteristics, and interpretive performance of screening mammography (ie, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value [PPV1], and the likelihood of cancer among women who were referred for biopsy [PPV2]). Measures of interpretive performance were ascertained prospectively from mammography interpretations and cancer data collected by the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses estimated the association between facility characteristics and mammography interpretive performance or accuracy (area under the ROC curve [AUC]). All P values were two-sided. RESULTS: Of the 53 eligible facilities, data on 44 could be analyzed. These 44 facilities accounted for 484 463 screening mammograms performed on 237 669 women, of whom 2686 were diagnosed with breast cancer during follow-up. Among the 44 facilities, mean sensitivity was 79.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 74.3% to 84.9%), mean specificity was 90.2% (95% CI = 88.3% to 92.0%), mean PPV1 was 4.1% (95% CI = 3.5% to 4.7%), and mean PPV2 was 38.8% (95% CI = 32.6% to 45.0%). The facilities varied statistically significantly in specificity (P < .001), PPV1 (P < .001), and PPV2 (P = .002) but not in sensitivity (P = .99).

METHODS: Women who underwent mammography at facilities participating in the National Cancer Institute's Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) during 1996 and who were subsequently diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive breast cancer were included in this study. Data from seven mammography registries were linked to population-based cancer and pathology registries. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to depict the number of months from the breast cancer diagnosis to the first mammogram within the defined follow-up period. Demographic, disease and treatment variables were included in univariate and multivariate analyses to identify factors predictive of women returning for mammography. RESULTS: Of the 2503 women diagnosed with breast cancer, 78.1% returned for mammography examination between 7 and 30 months following the diagnosis. Mammography facilities indicated that 66.8% of mammography examinations were classified as screening. Multivariate analyses found that women were most likely to undergo surveillance mammography if they were diagnosed at ages 60-69 with Stage 0, I or II breast cancer and had received radiation therapy in addition to surgery. CONCLUSIONS: While the majority of women return for mammographic surveillance following breast cancer, some important subgroups of women at higher risk for recurrence are less likely to return.

The goal of this paper is to define and differentiate measures of relative effectiveness of regimens and programs for disease prevention. Cancer screening is used to demonstrate how these measures differ in an example of two hypothetical screening regimens and programs. Conceptually and algebraically defined measures of relative regimen and program effectiveness also are presented. The measures evaluate preventive services that range from individual tests through organized, population-wide prevention programs. Examples illustrate how effective screening regimens may not result in effective screening programs and how measures can vary across subgroups and settings. Both regimen and program relative effectiveness measures assess benefits of prevention services in real-world settings, but each addresses different scientific and policy questions.

Here, PI3K pathway activation was assessed, in clinical tissue from 1,021 men with prostate cancers, using multiple pathway nodes that include PTEN, phosphorylated AKT (pAKT), phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (pS6), and stathmin. Based on these markers, a 9-point score of PI3K activation was created using the combined intensity of the 4-markers and analyzed its association with proliferation (Ki67), apoptosis (TUNEL), and androgen receptor (AR) status, as well as pathologic features and cancer-specific outcomes. In addition, the PI3K activation score was compared with mRNA expression profiling data for a large subset of men. Interestingly, those tumors with higher PI3K activation scores also had higher Gleason grade (P = 0.006), increased AR (r = 0.37; P < 0.001) and Ki67 (r = 0.24; P < 0.001), and decreased TUNEL (r = -0.12; P = 0.003). Although the PI3K activation score was not associated with an increased risk of lethal outcome, a significant interaction between lethal outcome, Gleason and high PI3K score (P = 0.03) was observed. Finally, enrichment of PI3K-specific pathways was found in the mRNA expression patterns differentiating the low and high PI3K activation scores; thus, the 4-marker IHC score of PI3K pathway activity correlates with features of PI3K activation. IMPLICATIONS: The relationship of this activation score to sensitivity to anti-PI3K agents remains to be tested but may provide more precision guidance when selecting patients for these therapies.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Prostate, Male Genital Organs",Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26124442,0,1,0,0

We report on the design of a stated preference study to assess homeless women's preferences for cervical cancer screening interventions, to inform efforts to overcome this disparity. METHODS: We conducted focus groups with homeless women (n = 8) on cervical cancer screening decisions and analyzed the data using thematic analysis. We applied inclusion criteria to select factors for a stated preference survey: importance to women, relevance to providers, feasibility, and consistency with clinical experience. We conducted pretests (n = 35) to assess survey procedures (functionality, recruitment, administration) and content (understanding, comprehension, wording/language, length). RESULTS: We chose best-worst scaling (BWS)-also known as object scaling-to identify decision-relevant screening intervention factors. We chose an experimental design with 11 ""objects"" (i.e., factors relevant to women's screening decision) presented in 11 subsets of five objects each.

METHODS: We compared 1419 women due for a screening mammogram based on the 1995 annual household income poverty definition for a family of four (<$15,000 vs. >$15,000). A telephone survey was used to collect information on household income, demographics, health behavior, attitudinal and facilitating variables.

RESULTS: Study included 2,412 patients followed for a median of 4.5 years; cumulatively, 1,117 (46%) patients had >/=1 adenoma at repeat colonoscopy. Compared with patients not receiving diabetes medications (n = 1,578), metformin-only use (n = 457) was associated with lower adenoma recurrence risk [adjusted HR, 0.76; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.65-0.89], and the association was stronger with increasing total metformin dose [quartile (Q) 1: HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.72-1.12; Q2: HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.70-1.12; Q3: HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.63-1.01; Q4: HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.42-0.60, Ptrend < 0.001]. Findings were unchanged in sensitivity analyses, including evaluating only outcomes during the 3- to 10-year period from baseline. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests a potential benefit of metformin use in lowering the risk of subsequent adenomas after polypectomy in patients with type 2 diabetes. IMPACT: Metformin may lower colorectal cancer risk by reducing the formation of precancerous lesions, reinforcing the potential additional benefits of its use.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Colorectal, Digestive Organs",Healthcare Delivery Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26377195,1,1,0,0

Prevention outcomes often have distributions that make them inappropriate for many popular statistical models that assume normality and are more appropriately considered ordinal outcomes. Despite this, the modeling of ordinal outcomes is often not well understood. This article discusses ways to analyze multilevel ordinal outcomes that are clustered or longitudinal, including the proportional odds regression model for ordinal outcomes, which assumes that the covariate effects are the same across the levels of the ordinal outcome. The article will cover how to test this assumption and what to do if it is violated.

Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 2015;24(12):1890-1897",2015,Methylated B3GAT2 and ZNF793 are potential detection biomarkers for Barrett's esophagus,"BACKGROUND: Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a preneoplastic condition in which normal esophageal squamous epithelium (SQ) is replaced by specialized intestinal metaplasia. It is the presumed precursor for esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) as well as the strongest risk factor for this cancer. Unfortunately, many patients with BE go undiagnosed under the current BE screening guidelines. The development of noninvasive and accurate BE detection assays could potentially identify many of these undiagnosed BE patients. METHODS: DNA methylation is a common epigenetic alteration in BE. Therefore, we conducted a genome-wide methylation screen to identify potential BE biomarkers. Samples from SQ (N = 12), stomach (N = 28), and BE (N = 29) were analyzed and methylation levels at over 485,000 CpG sites were compared. Pyrosequencing assays were used to validate the results and MethyLight assays were developed to detect the methylated alleles in endoscopic brushings. RESULTS: We discovered two genes, B3GAT2 and ZNF793, that are aberrantly methylated in BE. Clinical validation studies confirmed B3GAT2 and ZNF793 methylation levels were significantly higher in BE samples (median = 32.5% and 33.1%, respectively) than in control tissues (median = 2.29% and 2.52%, respectively; P < 0.0001 for both genes). Furthermore, gene-specific MethyLight assays could accurately detect BE (P < 0.0001 for both) in endoscopic brushing samples. CONCLUSION: B3GAT2 and ZNF793 are hypermethylated in BE, and the methylation status of these genes can be used to detect BE in tissue samples. IMPACT: These findings support the development of methylated B3GAT2 and ZNF793 as biomarkers for noninvasive assays for the detection of BE.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Esophagus, Digestive Organs",Surveillance Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26545406,0,1,0,0

The aim of this study was to assess reproducibility of the four-category BI-RADS density measure and examine its relationship with a continuous measure of percent density. We enrolled 19 radiologists, experienced in breast imaging, from a single integrated health care system. Radiologists interpreted 341 screening mammograms at two points in time 6 months apart. We assessed intra- and interobserver agreement in radiologists'; interpretations of BI-RADS density and explored whether agreement depended upon radiologist characteristics. We examined the relationship between BI-RADS density and percent density in a subset of 282 examinations. Intraradiologist agreement was moderate to substantial, with kappa varying across radiologists from 0.50 to 0.81 (mean = 0.69, 95% CI [0.63, 0.73]). Intraradiologist agreement was higher for radiologists with >/=10 years experience interpreting mammograms (difference in mean kappa = 0.10, 95% CI [0.01, 0.24]). Interradiologist agreement varied widely across radiologist pairs from slight to substantial, with kappa ranging from 0.02 to 0.72 (mean = 0.46, 95% CI [0.36, 0.55]). Of 145 examinations interpreted as nondense (BI-RADS density a or b) by the majority of radiologists, 82.8% were interpreted as dense (BI-RADS density c or d) by at least one radiologist. Of 187 examinations interpreted as dense by the majority of radiologists, 47.1% were interpreted as nondense by at least one radiologist. While the examinations of almost half of the women in our study were interpreted clinically as having BI-RADS density c or d, only about 10% of examinations had percent density >50%. Our results suggest that breast density reporting based on a single BI-RADS density interpretation may be misleading due to high interradiologist variability and a lack of correspondence between BI-RADS density and percent density.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Breast,Healthcare Delivery Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26133090,0,1,0,0

Population health effects will depend on cigarette smoking behaviors, levels of dual use with conventional cigarettes, and e-cigarette toxicity. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate potential health effects of various scenarios of increasing promotion and use of e-cigarettes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A base case model was developed using data on actual cigarette and e-cigarette use patterns that quantifies transitions from an initial state of no cigarette or e-cigarette use to 1 of 5 final states: never use of cigarettes or e-cigarettes, cigarette use, e-cigarette use, dual use of cigarettes and e-cigarettes, or quit. Seven scenarios were created that cover a range of use patterns, depending on how the e-cigarette market might develop, as well as a range of possible long-term health effects of e-cigarette use. Scenarios for changes from the base case were evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations. Separate sets of base case model parameters were evaluated for the US and UK populations. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We assigned unitless health ""costs"" for each final state on a scale of 0 to 100. Population health ""costs"" were compared with the base case (status quo) assuming e-cigarette use health ""costs"" from 1% to 50% as dangerous as conventional cigarette use health costs. RESULTS: Compared with the base case, a harm reduction scenario in which e-cigarette use increases only among smokers who are interested in quitting with more quit attempts and no increased initiation of e-cigarette use among nonsmokers, and another scenario in which e-cigarettes are taken up only by youth who would have smoked conventional cigarettes, had population-level health benefits regardless of e-cigarette health costs in both the United States and United Kingdom. Conversely, scenarios in which e-cigarette promotion leads to renormalization of cigarette smoking or e-cigarettes are used primarily by youth who never would have smoked showed net health harms across all e-cigarette health costs. In other scenarios, the net health effect varied on the basis of the health cost of e-cigarettes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: According to this analysis, widespread promotion of e-cigarettes may have a wide range of population-level health effects, depending on both e-cigarette health risks and patterns of use. Absent the primary effect of e-cigarette promotion being only to divert current or future conventional cigarette smokers to e-cigarette use, the current uncertainty about the health risks of e-cigarettes, increasing e-cigarette use among youth, and the varying health effects at different e-cigarette health costs suggest a potential for harm.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26322924,0,1,1,0

Data were from 7273 adults from 16 sites (11 countries) that were part of a coordinated multi-country cross-sectional study. Age moderated the associations of perceived crime safety, and perceiving no major physical barriers to walking, with MVPA: positive associations were only found in older adults. Perceived land use mix-access was linearly (positive) associated with MVPA in men, and curvilinearly in women. Perceived crime safety was related to MVPA only in women. No moderating relationships were found for education. Overall the associations of adults' perceptions of environmental attributes with MVPA were largely independent of the socio-demographic factors examined. These findings are encouraging, suggesting that efforts to optimize the perceived built and social environment may act in a socially-equitable manner to facilitate MVPA.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26454247,0,0,0,1

Eur J Epidemiol 2015;30(10):1129-1135",2015,Molecular pathological epidemiology gives clues to paradoxical findings,"A number of epidemiologic studies have described what appear to be paradoxical associations, where an incongruous relationship is observed between a certain well-established risk factor for disease incidence and favorable clinical outcome among patients with that disease. For example, the ""obesity paradox"" represents the association between obesity and better survival among patients with a certain disease such as coronary heart disease. Paradoxical observations cause vexing clinical and public health problems as they raise questions on causal relationships and hinder the development of effective interventions. Compelling evidence indicates that pathogenic processes encompass molecular alterations within cells and the microenvironment, influenced by various exogenous and endogenous exposures, and that interpersonal heterogeneity in molecular pathology and pathophysiology exists among patients with any given disease. In this article, we introduce methods of the emerging integrative interdisciplinary field of molecular pathological epidemiology (MPE), which is founded on the unique disease principle and disease continuum theory. We analyze and decipher apparent paradoxical findings, utilizing the MPE approach and available literature data on tumor somatic genetic and epigenetic characteristics. Through our analyses in colorectal cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and glioblastoma (malignant brain tumor), we can readily explain paradoxical associations between disease risk factors and better prognosis among disease patients. The MPE paradigm and approach can be applied to not only neoplasms but also various non-neoplastic diseases where there exists indisputable ubiquitous heterogeneity of pathogenesis and molecular pathology. The MPE paradigm including consideration of disease heterogeneity plays an essential role in advancements of precision medicine and public health.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Colorectal, Kidney, Brain/Central Nervous System, Digestive Organs, Urinary Tract",Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26445996,0,1,0,0

Each can have a broad spectrum of morphologic appearances, and 1 histotype can closely mimic histopathologic features more typical of another. Historically, there has been a relatively high frequency of mixed, defined by 2 or more distinct histotypes present on the basis of routine histopathologic assessment, histotype carcinoma diagnoses (3% to 11%); however, recent immunohistochemical (IHC) studies identifying histotype-specific markers and allowing more refined histotype diagnoses suggest a much lower incidence. We reviewed hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides from 871 cases of EOC and found the frequency of mixed carcinomas to be 1.7% when modern diagnostic criteria are applied. Through international collaboration, we established a cohort totaling 22 mixed EOCs, consisting of 9 EC/CCC, 4 EC/LGSC, 3 HGSC/CCC, 2 CCC/MC, and 4 other combinations. We interrogated the molecular differences between the different components of each case using IHC, gene expression, and hotspot sequencing analyses. IHC data alone suggested that 9 of the 22 cases were not mixed tumors, as they presented a uniform immuno-phenotype throughout, and these cases most probably represent morphologic mimicry and variation within tumors of a single histotype. Synthesis of molecular data further reduces the incidence of mixed carcinomas. On the basis of these results, true mixed carcinomas with both morphologic and molecular support for the presence of >1 histotype within a given tumor represent <1% of EOCs.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Ovary, Female Genital Organs",Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26099008,0,1,0,0

There are no published population-based reports of the likelihood of breast cancer death among US women with DCIS. METHODS: We used data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results program to determine the likelihood of breast cancer death at 5 and 10 years among US women aged 40 and older diagnosed with DCIS from 1978 to 1983 (before screening mammography was common; n = 1525) and from 1984 to 1989 (when screening mammography became common; n = 5547). We also calculated standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) to compare observed deaths from breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and all causes combined among women with DCIS with deaths expected based on general population mortality rates. RESULTS: Among women diagnosed with DCIS from 1978 to 1983, 1.5% died of breast cancer within 5 years and 3.4% within 10 years. Among women diagnosed from 1984 to 1989, 0.7% died of breast cancer within 5 years and 1.9% within 10 years. Relative to the general population, risk of breast cancer death was greater for women diagnosed from 1978 to 1983 (SMR, 3.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5-4.5) than for women diagnosed from 1984 to 1989 (10-year SMR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.5-2.3).

BMC Public Health 2012;12:456",2012,"Motivational interviewing for encouraging quit attempts among unmotivated smokers: study protocol of a randomized, controlled, efficacy trial","BACKGROUND: Although the current Clinical Practice Guideline recommend Motivational Interviewing for use with smokers not ready to quit, the strength of evidence for its use is rated as not optimal. The purpose of the present study is to address key methodological limitations of previous studies by ensuring fidelity in the delivery of the Motivational Interviewing intervention, using an attention-matched control condition, and focusing on unmotivated smokers whom meta-analyses have indicated may benefit most from Motivational Interviewing. It is hypothesized that MI will be more effective at inducing quit attempts and smoking cessation at 6-month follow-up than brief advice to quit and an intensity-matched health education condition. METHODS/DESIGN: A sample of adult community resident smokers (N = 255) who report low motivation and readiness to quit are being randomized using a 2:2:1 treatment allocation to Motivational Interviewing, Health Education, or Brief Advice. Over 6 months, participants in Motivational Interviewing and Health Education receive 4 individual counseling sessions and participants in Brief Advice receive one brief in-person individual session at baseline. Rigorous monitoring and independent verification of fidelity will assure the counseling approaches are distinct and delivered as planned. Participants complete surveys at baseline, week 12 and 6-month follow-up to assess demographics, smoking characteristics, and smoking outcomes. Participants who decide to quit are provided with a self-help guide to quitting, help with a quit plan, and free pharmacotherapy. The primary outcome is self-report of one or more quit attempts lasting at least 24 hours between randomization and 6-month follow-up. The secondary outcome is biochemically confirmed 7-day point prevalence cessation at 6-month follow-up. Hypothesized mediators of the presumed treatment effect on quit attempts are greater perceived autonomy support and autonomous motivation. Use of pharmacotherapy is a hypothesized mediator of Motivational Interviewing's effect on cessation. DISCUSSION: This trial will provide the most rigorous evaluation to date of Motivational Interviewing's efficacy for encouraging unmotivated smokers to make a quit attempt.

We carried out a pooled analysis of 8981 cases of head and neck cancer and 10 090 controls from 12 case-control studies with comparable information on mouthwash use in the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology Consortium. Logistic regression was used to assess the association of mouthwash use with cancers of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx, adjusting for study, age, sex, pack-years of tobacco smoking, number of alcoholic drinks/day, and education. Compared with never users of mouthwash, the odds ratio (OR) of all head and neck cancers was 1.01 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.94-1.08] for ever users, based on 12 studies. The corresponding ORs of cancer of the oral cavity and oropharynx were 1.11 (95% CI: 1.00-1.23) and 1.28 (95% CI: 1.06-1.56), respectively. OR for all head and neck cancer was 1.15 (95% CI: 1.01-1.30) for use for more than 35 years, based on seven studies (P for linear trend=0.01), and OR 1.31 (95% CI: 1.09-1.58) for use more than one per day, based on five studies (P for linear trend <0.001). Although limited by the retrospective nature of the study and the limited ability to assess risks of mouthwash use in nonusers of tobacco and alcohol, this large investigation shows potential risks for head and neck cancer subsites and in long-term and frequent users of mouthwash.

Arthritis Care Res (Hoboken) 2015;67(12):1686-1692",2015,Multidimensional model of disability and role functioning in rheumatoid arthritis,"OBJECTIVE: To examine a model addressing the roles of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease burden, mood disturbance, and disability as determinants of impairments in role functioning. METHODS: In a cross-sectional design, 103 RA patients recruited from the community to participate in a clinical trial completed assessments of self-assessed disease burden (total joint pain and disease activity), mood disturbance (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale depressed mood, somatic symptoms, lack of positive affect, and interpersonal problems), disability (Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index gross and fine motor), and role functioning (Short Form 36 health survey physical and social). Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to examine direct and indirect mechanisms linking disease burden to role functioning. RESULTS: SEM results indicated that the model had excellent fit: S-Bchi(2)(30) = 38.59, P = 0.135; comparative fit index = 0.977, standardized root mean residual = 0.062, and root mean square error of approximation = 0.053. Mediational analyses demonstrated that, while disease burden was associated with poor role functioning, its effects were jointly mediated by mood disturbance and disability. After the effects of mood disturbance and disability were taken into account, the effect of disease burden on role functioning was not significant. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that mood disturbance and disability may serve as important pathways through which RA disease burden affects role functioning. Future longitudinal research is suggested to replicate these findings and further explore the mediational mechanisms examined in this study.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26212464,0,1,1,0

The primary aims were to synthesize the findings of studies evaluating multilevel interventions (three or more levels of influence) targeted at ethnic and racial minorities to reduce disparities in their health care and obtain a quantitative estimate of the effect of multilevel interventions on health outcomes among these subgroups. The electronic database PubMed was searched using Medical Subject Heading terms and key words. After initial review of abstracts, 26 published studies were systematically reviewed by at least two independent coders. Those with sufficient data (n = 12) were assessed by meta-analysis and examined for quality using a modified nine-item Physiotherapy Evidence Database coding scheme. The findings from this descriptive review suggest that multilevel interventions have positive effects on several health behavior outcomes, including cancer prevention and screening, as well improving the quality of health-care system processes. The weighted average effect size across studies for all health behavior outcomes reported at the individual participant level (k = 17) was odds ratio (OR) = 1.27 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.11 to 1.44); for the outcomes reported by providers or organizations, the weighted average effect size (k = 3) was OR = 2.53 (95% CI = 0.82 to 7.81).

The antigen processing and presentation pathway was consistently significant (P = 0.001, = 0.004, and < 0.001, respectively). Versatile gene-based association study approach was applied to the top-ranked pathway and identified the driven genes. By comparing the expression of the genes in RCC tumor and adjacent normal tissues, we observed significant overexpression of HLA genes in tumor tissues, which was also supported by public databases. We sought to validate genetic variants in antigen processing and presentation pathway in an independent GWAS dataset comprised of 1,311 RCC cases and 3,424 control subjects from the National Cancer Institute; one SNP, rs1063355, was significant in both populations (P(meta-analysis) = 9.15 x 10(-)(4), P(heterogeneity) = 0.427).

We have fine-mapped 64 GWAS regions known at the conclusion of the iCOGS study using large-scale genotyping and imputation in 25 723 PrCa cases and 26 274 controls of European ancestry. We detected evidence for multiple independent signals at 16 regions, 12 of which contained additional newly identified significant associations. A single signal comprising a spectrum of correlated variation was observed at 39 regions; 35 of which are now described by a novel more significantly associated lead SNP, while the originally reported variant remained as the lead SNP only in 4 regions. We also confirmed two association signals in Europeans that had been previously reported only in East-Asian GWAS. Based on statistical evidence and linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure, we have curated and narrowed down the list of the most likely candidate causal variants for each region. Functional annotation using data from ENCODE filtered for PrCa cell lines and eQTL analysis demonstrated significant enrichment for overlap with bio-features within this set. By incorporating the novel risk variants identified here alongside the refined data for existing association signals, we estimate that these loci now explain approximately 38.9% of the familial relative risk of PrCa, an 8.9% improvement over the previously reported GWAS tag SNPs. This suggests that a significant fraction of the heritability of PrCa may have been hidden during the discovery phase of GWAS, in particular due to the presence of multiple independent signals within the same region.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Prostate, Male Genital Organs",Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26025378,0,1,0,0

Gastroenterology 2015;149(6):1446-1453",2015,Mutation spectrum and risk of colorectal cancer in African American families with Lynch syndrome,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: African Americans (AAs) have the highest incidence of and mortality resulting from colorectal cancer (CRC) in the United States. Few data are available on genetic and nongenetic risk factors for CRC among AAs. Little is known about cancer risks and mutations in mismatch repair (MMR) genes in AAs with the most common inherited CRC condition, Lynch syndrome. We aimed to characterize phenotype, mutation spectrum, and risk of CRC in AAs with Lynch syndrome. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of AAs with mutations in MMR genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2) using databases from 13 US referral centers. We analyzed data on personal and family histories of cancer. Modified segregation analysis conditioned on ascertainment criteria was used to estimate age- and sex-specific CRC cumulative risk, studying members of the mutation-carrying families. RESULTS: We identified 51 AA families with deleterious mutations that disrupt function of the MMR gene product: 31 in MLH1 (61%), 11 in MSH2 (21%), 3 in MSH6 (6%), and 6 in PMS2 (12%); 8 mutations were detected in more than 1 individual, and 11 have not been previously reported. In the 920 members of the 51 families with deleterious mutations, the cumulative risks of CRC at 80 years of age were estimated to be 36.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.5%-83.9%) for men and 29.7% (95% CI, 8.31%-76.1%) for women. CRC risk was significantly higher among individuals with mutations in MLH1 or MSH2 (hazard ratio, 13.9; 95% CI, 3.44-56.5). CONCLUSIONS: We estimate the cumulative risk for CRC in AAs with MMR gene mutations to be similar to that of individuals of European descent with Lynch syndrome. Two-thirds of mutations were found in MLH1, some of which were found in multiple individuals and some that have not been previously reported. Differences in mutation spectrum are likely to reflect the genetic diversity of this population.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Colon, Colorectal, Digestive Organs",Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26248088,0,1,0,1

Mutational profiling can establish clonal or independent origin in synchronous bilateral breast and other tumors. PLoS One 2015;10(11)",2015,Mutational profiling can establish clonal or independent origin in synchronous bilateral breast and other tumors,"BACKGROUND: Synchronous tumors can be independent primary tumors or a primary-metastatic (clonal) pair, which may have clinical implications. Mutational profiling of tumor DNA is increasingly common in the clinic. We investigated whether mutational profiling can distinguish independent from clonal tumors in breast and other cancers, using a carefully defined test based on the Clonal Likelihood Score (CLS = 100 x # shared high confidence (HC) mutations/ # total HC mutations). METHODS: Statistical properties of a formal test using the CLS were investigated. A high CLS is evidence in favor of clonality; the test is implemented as a one-sided binomial test of proportions. Test parameters were empirically determined using 16,422 independent breast tumor pairs and 15 primary-metastatic tumor pairs from 10 cancer types using The Cancer Genome Atlas. RESULTS: We validated performance of the test with its established parameters, using five published data sets comprising 15,758 known independent tumor pairs (maximum CLS = 4.1%, minimum p-value = 0.48) and 283 known tumor clonal pairs (minimum CLS 13%, maximum p-value <0.01), across renal cell, testicular, and colorectal cancer. The CLS test correctly classified all validation samples but one, which it appears may have been incorrectly classified in the published data. As proof-of-concept we then applied the CLS test to two new cases of invasive synchronous bilateral breast cancer at our institution, each with one hormone receptor positive (ER+/PR+/HER2-) lobular and one triple negative ductal carcinoma. High confidence mutations were identified by exome sequencing and results were validated using deep targeted sequencing. The first tumor pair had CLS of 81% (p-value < 10-15), supporting clonality. In the second pair, no common mutations of 184 variants were validated (p-value >0.99), supporting independence. A plausible molecular mechanism for the shift from hormone receptor positive to triple negative was identified in the clonal pair. CONCLUSION: We have developed the statistical properties of a carefully defined Clonal Likelihood Score test from mutational profiling of tumor DNA. Under identified conditions, the test appears to reliably distinguish between synchronous tumors of clonal and of independent origin in several cancer types. This approach may have scientific and clinical utility.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Breast,Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26554380,0,1,0,0

The Patient-Centered Outcomes Working Group, charged with summarizing the HRQOL evidence base, used a scoping review approach to efficiently survey the large body of literature in adult and pediatric HCT survivors over 1 year after transplantation. The goals of this paper are to (1) summarize the current literature describing patient-centered outcomes in survivors, including the various dimensions of health-related quality of life affected by HCT, and describe interventions tested to improve these outcomes; (2) highlight areas with sufficient evidence allowing for integration into standard practice; (3) address methodological issues that restrict progress in this field; (4) identify major gaps to guide future research; and (5) specify priority research recommendations. Patient-centered outcomes were summarized within physical, psychological, social, and environmental domains, as well as for adherence to treatment, and health behaviors. Interventions to improve outcomes were evaluated for evidence of efficacy, although few interventions have been tested in long-term HCT survivors. Methodologic issues defined included lack of consistency in the selection of patient-centered outcome measures, along with the absence of a standard for timing, frequency, and mode of administration. Recommendations for HCT survivorship care included integration of annual screening of patient-centered outcomes, use of evidence-based practice guidelines, and provision of treatment summaries and survivorship care plans after HCT. Three priority research recommendations included the following: (1) design and test risk-targeted interventions with dose-intensity modulation matching the needs of HCT survivors with priority domains, including sexual dysfunction, fatigue, sleep disruption, nonadherence to medications and recommended health care, health behaviors including physical inactivity and healthy eating, and psychological dysfunction, with particular consideration of novel technologies to reach HCT survivors distant from their transplantation centers; (2) design a consensus-based methodologic framework for outcomes evaluation; and (3) evaluate and compare existing practices for integrating patient-centered outcome screening and interventions across HCT survivorship programs.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,"Healthcare Delivery Research Program, Office of Cancer Survivorship",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27660168,0,0,0,0

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a negative energy balance induced by voluntary wheel running on polyps, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and corticosterone in Min mice. Seven-week-old male Min mice were randomly assigned to control (CON, n = 23) or wheel running (EX, n = 24) conditions for a 10-week study period. All mice had water and AIN-76A diet ad libitum for the first approximately 3 weeks on study, after which the EX group was pair-fed to the CON group to maintain a negative energy balance due to the exercise. EX mice voluntarily ran 3.8 km/day (2.7-6.0 km/day) (median, interquartile range) and weighed less than CON mice throughout the study. More CON mice died before the end of the study versus EX mice (26 versus 0%, P < 0.01). CON mice had significantly more polyps versus EX mice (21.6 +/- 1.5 versus 16.9 +/- 2.0, P < 0.01; mean +/- SE), and daily running distance in EX was inversely correlated with total polyp number (r = -0.70, P < 0.01).

We hypothesized that some of these loci function through nearby transcription factor (TF) genes and that putative target genes of these TFs as identified by coexpression may also be enriched for additional EOC risk associations. METHODS: We selected TF genes within 1 Mb of the top signal at the 12 genome-wide significant risk loci. Mutual information, a form of correlation, was used to build networks of genes strongly coexpressed with each selected TF gene in the unified microarray dataset of 489 serous EOC tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Genes represented in this dataset were subsequently ranked using a gene-level test based on results for germline SNPs from a serous EOC GWAS meta-analysis (2,196 cases/4,396 controls). RESULTS: Gene set enrichment analysis identified six networks centered on TF genes (HOXB2, HOXB5, HOXB6, HOXB7 at 17q21.32 and HOXD1, HOXD3 at 2q31) that were significantly enriched for genes from the risk-associated end of the ranked list (P < 0.05 and FDR < 0.05).

Addict Behav 2015;50:161-164",2015,New methods shed light on age of onset as a risk factor for nicotine dependence,"INTRODUCTION: Early onset of substance use is a risk factor for later drug use, abuse, and dependence. This study examines how the rate of nicotine dependence differs as a function of age of onset of regular smoking in continuous time, in order to identify critical age periods that are most predictive of later dependence for males and females. METHODS: Time-varying effect modeling (TVEM) can reveal specific ages of onset that confer greatest risk for adult nicotine dependence. The rate of dependence in adulthood is modeled as a flexible function of age of onset using a subset of adults (N = 15,748) from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions who ever smoked regularly. RESULTS: The peak risk of adult nicotine dependence coincides with onset of regular use at approximately 10 years old, with an elevated risk persisting to 20 years. The risk of dependence is significantly higher for females compared to males for onset of regular use between ages 9 and 18. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that the risk of adult nicotine dependence is highest when onset of regular smoking occurs at around 10 years, though the associated risk is high for ages of onset into young adulthood. Early onset of regular use is a relatively stronger risk factor for adolescent females than males. Smoking prevention programs should focus on late childhood through early adolescence, particularly among females. TVEM provides a more nuanced understanding of the risk associated with different ages of onset of health risk behaviors.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26151579,0,0,1,0

Participants were highly nicotine dependent (average FTND score: 6.3). There were statistically significant differences in smoking behavior between cigarette and cigarillo smoking in time to smoke, number of puffs, and total puff volume (all P<0.001). Average puff duration, interpuff interval average puff volume, and puff velocity did not differ between cigarettes and cigarillos. Nicotine boost was similar after both cigarettes and cigarillos. COex boost was significantly greater after cigarillo smoking compared to cigarette smoking (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The smoking pattern and exposure profile indicate that dual users inhale cigarillo smoke just as they inhale cigarette smoke thereby exposing themselves to considerable amounts of nicotine and other components of tobacco smoke. COex exposure results imply that cigarillo smoking may be associated with higher exposure to smoke-delivered volatile components of mainstream cigarillo smoke including carcinogens when compared to cigarettes. IMPACT: The findings that cigarillos and cigarettes are smoked similarly in dual users are relevant to health and regulatory considerations on cigar products.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26459155,0,1,1,0

DESIGN: The 2003 and 2006/07 Tobacco Use Supplements to the Current Population Surveys were pooled to conduct secondary data analysis. SETTING: National data were collected using in-person and telephone computer-assisted interviews by the United States Census Bureau among civilian, non-institutionalized people aged 15 years and older. PARTICIPANTS: Data were analyzed among daily current smokers aged 18+ (n = 46,273). MEASUREMENTS: The associations between usual cigarette brand and time to first cigarette within 5 and 30 minutes after waking, quit attempts in the past 12 months and length of smoking abstinence in the past 12 months were examined. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were stratified by smoking intensity: </=5, 6-10, 11-19 and 20+ cigarettes per day. FINDINGS: Menthol smokers reported a mean of 13.05 compared with 15.01 cigarettes per day among non-menthol smokers (P < 0.001). Multivariate results showed that among smokers consuming 6-10 cigarettes per day, menthol smokers were significantly more likely than non-menthol smokers to consume their first cigarette within 5 minutes after waking (odds ratio = 1.22, 95% confidence interval = 1.05,1.43). The multivariate models did not show significant associations between usual cigarette brand and quit attempts in past 12 months or duration of smoking abstinence >2 weeks in the past 12 months.

METHODS: We prospectively collected data during 1996-2005 on 287,115 postmenopausal women not using hormone therapy (HT) who underwent 614,562 mammography examinations; 4,446 women were diagnosed with breast cancer within 12 months of a mammography examination. We calculated rates per 1,000 mammography examinations of large (>15 mm), advanced-stage (IIb, III, or IV), high-grade (3 or 4), estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and -negative, and screen-detected and non-screen-detected breast cancer across body mass index (BMI, kg/m(2)) groups defined as normal (18.5-24.9), overweight (25.0-29.9), obese class I (30.0-34.9), and obese class II/III (> or =35.0), adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, and mammography registry and use. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Adjusted rates per 1000 mammography examinations of overall breast cancer increased across BMI groups (6.6 normal, 7.4 overweight, 7.9 obese I, 8.5 obese II/III; P(trend) < .001), as did rates of advanced disease, including large invasive (2.3 normal, 2.6 overweight, 2.9 obese I, 3.2 obese II/III; P(trend) < .001), advanced-stage (0.8 normal, 0.9 overweight, 1.3 obese I, 1.5 obese II/III; P(trend) < .001), and high nuclear grade (1.5 normal, 1.7 overweight, 1.7 obese I, 1.9 obese II/III; P(trend) = .10) tumors.

AIMS: To better elucidate this relationship by including known risk factors in a large case-control study of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) from the greater Boston area. METHODS: We analysed the relationship between occupational asphalt exposure and HNSCC among men in the Greater Boston area of Massachusetts. Analyses were conducted using unconditional multivariable logistic regression, performed with adjustments for age, race, education, smoking, alcohol consumption and HPV serology. RESULTS: There were 753 cases and 913 controls. No associations between HNSCC and occupational asphalt exposure (neither among ever-exposed nor by occupational duration) were observed for exposures in any occupation or those restricted to the construction industry. We also observed no associations in subgroup analyses of never-smokers and ever-smokers. Adjusting for known risk factors further reduced the estimated effect of asphalt exposure on HNSCC risk. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence for an association between occupational asphalt exposure and HNSCC. The null findings from this well-controlled analysis could suggest that the risk estimates stemming from occupational cohort studies may be overestimated due to uncontrolled confounding and enhance the literature available for weighing cancer risk from occupational exposure to bitumen.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Head and Neck,Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26272381,0,1,1,1

RESULTS: Participants were mainly daily (52%) and non-daily (41%) smokers. While experimentation with electronic cigarette devices was frequently reported, participants related an overall lack of information about the devices and what they did know often reflected messages in e-cigarette marketing campaigns. Participants also used their own bodily sensations as a way to gauge potential risks and benefits of the products. Finally, young adults, steeped in a culture of personal technologies, perceived e-cigarettes as one more 'toy' among other technologies integrated into their everyday lives.

The authors investigated the association between postdiagnosis opioid use and breast cancer recurrence. METHODS: Patients with incident, early stage breast cancer who were diagnosed during 1996 through 2008 in Denmark were identified from the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group Registry. Opioid prescriptions were ascertained from the Danish National Prescription Registry. Follow-up began on the date of primary surgery for breast cancer and continued until breast cancer recurrence, death, emigration, 10 years, or July 31, 2013, whichever occurred first. Cox regression models were used to compute hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals associating breast cancer recurrence with opioid prescription use overall and by opioid type and strength, immunosuppressive effect, chronic use (>/=6 months of continuous exposure), and cumulative morphine-equivalent dose, adjusting for confounders. RESULTS: In total, 34,188 patients were identified who, together, contributed 283,666 person-years of follow-up. There was no association between ever-use of opioids and breast cancer recurrence (crude hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% confidence interval, 0.90-1.1; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.0; 95% confidence interval, 0.92-1.1), regardless of opioid type, strength, chronicity of use, or cumulative dose. Breast cancer recurrence rates were lower among users of strongly (but not weakly) immunosuppressive opioids, possibly because of channeling bias among those with a high competing risk, because mortality was higher among users of this drug type. CONCLUSIONS: This large, prospective cohort study provided no clinically relevant evidence of an association between opioid prescriptions and breast cancer recurrence. The current findings are important to cancer survivorship, because opioids are frequently used to manage pain associated with comorbid conditions.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Breast,Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26207518,0,1,1,0

Stat Med 2015;34(26):3424-3443",2015,Optimization of multi-stage dynamic treatment regimes utilizing accumulated data,"In medical therapies involving multiple stages, a physician's choice of a subject's treatment at each stage depends on the subject's history of previous treatments and outcomes. The sequence of decisions is known as a dynamic treatment regime or treatment policy. We consider dynamic treatment regimes in settings where each subject's final outcome can be defined as the sum of longitudinally observed values, each corresponding to a stage of the regime. Q-learning, which is a backward induction method, is used to first optimize the last stage treatment then sequentially optimize each previous stage treatment until the first stage treatment is optimized. During this process, model-based expectations of outcomes of late stages are used in the optimization of earlier stages. When the outcome models are misspecified, bias can accumulate from stage to stage and become severe, especially when the number of treatment stages is large. We demonstrate that a modification of standard Q-learning can help reduce the accumulated bias. We provide a computational algorithm, estimators, and closed-form variance formulas. Simulation studies show that the modified Q-learning method has a higher probability of identifying the optimal treatment regime even in settings with misspecified models for outcomes. It is applied to identify optimal treatment regimes in a study for advanced prostate cancer and to estimate and compare the final mean rewards of all the possible discrete two-stage treatment sequences.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Prostate, Digestive Organs",Surveillance Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26095711,0,0,0,0

To minimize the impact of batch effects, an ideal experiment design should ensure the even distribution of biological groups and confounding factors across batches.

However, clinical studies indicated conflicting results. In this study, we compared the overall survival (OS) of postmenopausal patients with nonmetastatic invasive breast cancer who received any of the second-generation nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates for osteopenia or osteoporosis, with the survival of those who did not. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study at the Wayne State University/Karmanos Cancer institute (KCI) in Detroit, Michigan and extracted data from the Metropolitan Detroit Cancer Surveillance System (MDCSS), a Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registry. Patients > 50 years of age with stage I, II, or III invasive breast cancer between the years 2000 through 2003 were included. Information regarding medications was extracted from the patients' medical records. RESULTS: A total of 696 women with stage I-III breast cancer were included. Ninety-seven women (14%) used nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates. The difference in OS between bisphosphonate users and nonusers was not statistically significant (P = .32) at 3 years. After adjusting for differences between the groups in age, stage of disease, hormone receptor status, endocrine therapy, vitamin D, and calcium use, there was a marginally significant (P = .07) difference in survival; bisphosphonate users had poorer survival than nonusers. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the use of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates is not associated with improved OS in patients with nonmetastatic breast cancer, even after adjusting for known prognostic factors, but with a marginally worse OS.

This cross-sectional study sought support for a model connecting parental cancer to child distress through its impact on parenting self-efficacy beliefs and parenting behaviors by examining relations among parental illness, quality of life/parent functioning, parenting efficacy beliefs, and concerns about children's emotional distress. METHODS: One hundred ninety-four adult oncology outpatients with children who were 18 years old or younger completed questionnaires assessing their health-related quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General), depression and anxiety symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), overall distress (Distress Thermometer), and parenting efficacy beliefs and parenting concerns (Parenting Concerns Questionnaire). RESULTS: Parenting efficacy scores for parents and coparents declined significantly after diagnosis. This decline correlated with more visits to a medical clinic, treatment with intravenous chemotherapy in the past month, poorer health-related quality of life, and more depression and distress. Parents experiencing the most concern about the impact of mood, physical limitations, and changes in routines on their children experienced the biggest declines in their own sense of efficacy as parents and in their belief in their coparent's efficacy. Finally, declines in parenting efficacy beliefs correlated with parental concerns about children's emotional distress about aspects of the parent's illness.

SETTING: The questionnaires were administered by mail, and responses were returned to the originating screening center. PARTICIPANTS: The participants in this study consisted of all the active participants at three PLCO screening centers: the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, the University of Utah, and Henry Ford Health System. METHODS: A short, self-administered questionnaire was mailed to all active participants at three PLCO centers (n=41,482).

METHODS: Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium data from 1996-2001 were used to identify pathology specimens that were obtained within 1 year of screening mammograms performed on 786,846 women ages 40-89 years. The pathology results were classified as invasive carcinoma, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), or benign. The associations between overall pathology outcomes and invasive tumor size and lymph node status were analyzed by age and mammography assessment category. RESULTS: The rates of both recommending and performing a biopsy varied little with age. The 1,664,032 screening mammograms were followed by 26,748 known biopsies (1.6%) and 8815 diagnoses of breast carcinoma (0.53%). Overall, 81% of carcinomas were invasive, and 78% of those were pathologically lymph node-negative tumors, in contrast to the 66% prevalence observed in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data during the same period. Most invasive tumors measured between 0 mm and 10 mm (35%) or between 11 mm and 20 mm (36%) in greatest dimension, and 92% and 78% were lymph node-negative tumors, respectively: Biopsy results that were classified as malignant increased with age (P < 0.0001) and were most likely to follow Breast Imaging, Reporting, and Diagnosis System Category 5 and 4 assessments, respectively. Ductal hyperplasia (19.6%), fibroadenoma (18.5%), and other benign findings (56.1%) were the most common benign diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: Pathologically negative lymph nodes were more prevalent in this mammographically screened population than in the overall SEER population.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the overall visit structure and how patients and physicians transition between communication activities during visits in which patients received new prostate cancer diagnoses. PARTICIPANTS: Forty veterans and 18 urologists at one VA medical centre. METHODS: We coded 40 transcripts to identify major communication activities during visits and used empiric discourse analysis to analyse transitions between activities. RESULTS: We identified five communication activities that occurred in the following typical sequence: 'diagnosis delivery', 'risk classification', 'options talk', 'decision talk' and 'next steps'. The first two activities were typically brief and involved minimal patient participation. Options talk was typically the longest activity; physicians explicitly announced the beginning of options talk and framed it as their professional responsibility. Some patients were unsure of the purpose of visit and/or who should make treatment decisions. CONCLUSION: Visits to deliver the diagnosis of early stage prostate cancer follow a regular sequence of communication activities. Physicians focus on discussing treatment options and devote comparatively little time and attention to discussing the new cancer diagnosis. Towards the goal of promoting patient-centred communication, physicians should consider eliciting patient reactions after diagnosis delivery and explaining the decision-making process before describing treatment options.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Prostate, Male Genital Organs",Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=24372758,0,1,0,0

PATIENTS AND METHODS: For 4,093 patients with lung cancer and 3,685 patients with colorectal cancer in multiple US regions and health care delivery systems, we conducted telephone surveys of patients or their surrogates in English, Spanish, or Chinese at 4 to 7 months after diagnosis. The surveys assessed ratings of the overall quality of cancer care and experiences with three domains of interpersonal care (physician communication, nursing care, and coordination and responsiveness of care). RESULTS: English-speaking Asian/Pacific Islander patients and Chinese-speaking patients and those in worse health reported significantly worse adjusted experiences with all three domains of interpersonal care, whereas white, black, and Hispanic patients reported generally similar experiences with interpersonal care. The overall quality of cancer care was rated as excellent by 44.4% of patients with lung cancer and 53.0% of patients with colorectal cancer, and these ratings were most strongly correlated with positive experiences with coordination and responsiveness of care (Spearman rank coefficients of 0.49 and 0.42 for lung and colorectal cancer, respectively). After multivariate adjustment, excellent ratings were less common for each cancer among black patients, English-speaking Asian/Pacific Islander patients, Chinese-speaking patients, and patients reporting worse health status (all P </= .05).

However, few studies include detailed information on patient, clinical and health system characteristics in the evaluation of surgical management and the use of systemic therapies in community practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated surgical management and the use of systemic treatments in a national population based sample of 1,263 patients with renal cell carcinoma newly diagnosed in 2004. Patients were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program as part of the Patterns of Care studies. We used descriptive statistics to assess treatment in the entire sample and logistic regression analysis to evaluate the associations between patient demographic, clinical and health system characteristics, and surgery in the subset of 1,032 patients who were potentially eligible for partial or radical nephrectomy and an open or laparoscopic procedure. RESULTS: Surgical treatment in 64.7% of patients (95% CI 60.0%, 69.1%) was radical nephrectomy and most underwent an open rather than a laparoscopic procedure. Although the proportion of all patients receiving systemic treatments was small, 34.3% (95% CI 23.1, 47.5) of those with stage IV disease received systemic treatment. Few patients participated in clinical trials. On multivariate analysis patients who were female, nonwhite, with larger tumors, without comorbid conditions and treated at hospitals without a residency training program were more likely to undergo radical rather than partial nephrectomy (p <0.05). Patients with larger tumors treated at smaller hospitals were more likely to undergo an open rather than a laparoscopic procedure (p <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In 2004 open radical nephrectomy was the most common surgical management for renal cell carcinoma. Few patients received systemic therapy.

Few studies have evaluated the adoption of therapies and temporal changes in patterns of care. METHODS: Patients age 20 years and older diagnosed with stages II/III CRC were randomly sampled from the population-based Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program in 1990-1991, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010 (n = 7057). Therapy was obtained from medical records and physician verification. We described the receipt of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Log-binomial regression was used to examine factors associated with therapy. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Chemotherapy receipt among colon cancer patients increased from 1990 (stage II: 22.5%; stage III: 56.3%) to 2005 (stage II: 32.1%; stage III: 72.4%) and declined slightly in 2010 (stage II: 29.3%; stage III: 66.4%). Stage III colon cancer patients who were older (vs <55 years, 75-79 years: risk ratio [RR] 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.71 to 0.91; ?80 years: RR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.28 to 0.47) or had a comorbidity score of 2 or higher (vs 0, RR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.35 to 0.87) received chemotherapy less often. Receipt of radiation therapy by rectal cancer patients increased across all years from 45.5% to 66.1%. Increasing age (vs <55 years, 75-79 years: RR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.47 to 0.74; ?80 years: RR = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.25 to 0.45) was associated with lower chemoradiation use among stage II/III rectal cancer patients. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate increased adoption of chemotherapy and radiation therapy for colon and rectal cancer patients and differences in therapy by age, comorbidity, and diagnosis year.

Our sample consists of men and women > or = 50 years never diagnosed with colorectal cancer and who reported a recent fecal occult blood test and/or endoscopy. RESULTS: In 2003, both men and women reported higher rates of colonoscopy (32.2% and 29.8%, respectively) than use of FOBT (16.1% and 15.3%, respectively) or sigmoidoscopy (7.6% and 5.9%, respectively). Men reported higher use of endoscopy than women if they had a usual source of health care, had talked to a general doctor, and had two to five visits to the doctor in the past year. Men and women 65 years and older had higher rates of any recommended colorectal cancer test (55.8% and 48.5%, respectively) than persons 50 to 64 years (males, 41.0%; females, 31.4%). Use of colorectal cancer tests also was higher among both genders if they were not Hispanic, had higher educational attainment, were former smokers, had health insurance or a usual source of care, or if they talked to a general doctor. Recent use of colorectal cancer tests has increased since 2000 for both women and men largely due to increased use of colonoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Colorectal cancer testing is increasing for both men and women, although the prevalence of testing remains higher in men. Our data support previous findings documenting socioeconomic disparities in colorectal cancer test use.

METHODS: We used latent class analysis to examine patterns of sun protective behaviors in a cross-sectional survey of Hispanic elementary students participating in a sun safety intervention in Los Angeles from 2013- to 2014 (N=972). Five behavior indicators in two environments (school and home) representing multiple methods of sun protection were selected for the model. RESULTS: Results suggested a four-class model best fit the data. Classes were labeled in order of increasing risk as multiple protective behaviors (28%), clothing and shade (32%), pants only (15%), and low/inconsistent protective behaviors (25%). Children who reported high parental engagement with sun protection were significantly more likely to be classified in high overall protective categories (odds ratio (OR)=4.77). Girls were more likely than boys to be classified in the highest protecting class (OR=3.46), but were also more likely to be in the ""pants only"" class (OR=2.65). Sensitivity to sunburn was associated with less likelihood of being in the ""clothing and shade"" class (OR=0.53). CONCLUSION: The differences among these classes and their predictors reveal the heterogeneity and complexity of Hispanic children's sun protective behaviors. These findings have implications for the design and delivery of future sun protection interventions targeting Hispanic children, as strategies tailored to specific subgroups may be more effective in achieving meaningful behavioral changes.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Melanoma, Skin",Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26436682,1,1,0,1

METHODS: A nationally representative cross-sectional survey of pediatricians and family practice physicians sampled from the American Medical Association (AMA) Masterfile was conducted in 2008 and analyzed in 2010. Outcomes included physicians' self-reported practice behaviors regarding assessments of pediatric patients' weight status, counseling of diet and physical activity, and referrals and follow-ups. RESULTS: Response rate excluding physicians listed as 'no-contact' by the AMA was 73.7% among pediatricians and 66.9% among family physicians.

However, little is known about current perceptions of women smoking in China. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to examine smokers' and non-smokers' perceived acceptability of female smoking and how it changed over time in China. METHODS: Data come from Waves 1 to 3 (2006-2009) of the International Tobacco Control China Survey, a face-to-face cohort survey of approximately 800 adult smokers and 200 non-smokers in each of seven cities in mainland China. RESULTS: At Wave 3 (2009), about 38% of smokers and 9% of non-smokers agreed that female smoking is acceptable with women being almost twice as likely to do so as men (67% vs 36% and 11% vs 6%, respectively). In addition to women, smokers who were younger and had more positive perceptions of smoking in general were more likely to say that female smoking is acceptable. This perception significantly increased from Wave 1 (2006) to Wave 3 (2009), as did the perception that smoking is a sign of sophistication, but other general perceptions of smoking did not significantly change between 2006 and 2009. CONCLUSIONS: Norms against female smoking appear to remain strong in China, but female smoking may be becoming more acceptable. It is important to monitor these perceptions to prevent a rise in female smoking prevalence along with an increase in tobacco-related death and disease among women in China.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26240136,0,0,1,0

Federal agencies are now progressively starting to fund combined programs to address common risk. The purpose of this study was to inform transitions to coordinated chronic disease prevention by learning views on perceived benefits and challenges of a coordinated approach to funding. METHODS: A national survey on evidence-based public health was conducted from March through May 2013 among state health department employees working in chronic disease prevention (N = 865). Participants were asked to rank the top 3 benefits and top 3 challenges in coordinating chronic disease approaches from provided lists and could provide additional responses. Descriptive analyses, chi(2) tests, and analysis of variance were conducted. RESULTS: The most common perceived benefits of coordinated approaches to chronic disease prevention were improved health outcomes, common risk factors better addressed, and reduced duplication of program efforts. The most common perceived challenges were funding restrictions, such as disease-specific performance measures; competing priorities; lack of communication across programs; funding might be reduced; agency not structured for program coordination; and loss of disease-specific partner support. Rankings of benefits and challenges were similar across states and participant roles; the perceived challenges ""lack of communication across programs"" (P = .02) and ""funding might be reduced"" differed by program area (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Findings can be used by funding agencies and state health departments for planning, training, and technical assistance.

RESULTS: Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians reported lower perceived cancer risk than whites [Bs = -0.40, -0.34, and -0.69, respectively; (Ps < 0.001)]. Contributing factors included relatively lower likelihood of reporting a family history of cancer, lower likelihood of having smoked, and a less strong belief that everything causes cancer among nonwhites than among whites. Racial/ethnic differences in perceived risk were attenuated in older respondents because perceived cancer risk was negatively associated with age for whites but not for nonwhites. CONCLUSIONS: Nonwhites had lower perceptions of cancer risk than whites.

This study used an actor-partner interdependence model to estimate the dyadic association between perceived weight status and barriers to physical activity in dyads of adults and their adolescent children. It was hypothesized that greater perceived weight would be associated with greater barriers perceived by both one's self and one's partner. METHOD: Data from 1,568 dyads in the Family Life, Activity, Sun, Health, and Eating study were used to examine the dyadic association between perceived weight status (i.e., greater perceived weight category) and barriers to physical activity. Models were stratified by actual weight (an overweight or obese dyad member vs. two normal weight dyad members) and adjusted for parent education, parent and adolescent age, gender, and race. RESULTS: Among dyads with at least 1 overweight/obese member, greater perceived weight status was positively associated with one's own perceived barriers (significant actor effects, betas = 1.17 and 1.03, ps < 0.01) and one's partner's perceived barriers (significant partner effects, betas = 0.38 and 0.62, ps < 0.01). No statistically significant relationships were found for dyads with only normal weight members. CONCLUSIONS: Among dyads with at least 1 overweight or obese member, significant partner effects for parents and adolescents demonstrate that the weight perception of 1 dyad member correlates with the barriers of the other member.

Increased motivation was observed if participants focused on similarities with patients 'doing better' (i.e. high coping effectiveness/low symptom severity) and decreased motivation if they focused on similarities with patients 'doing worse' (low coping effectiveness/high symptom severity). CONCLUSIONS: Providing social comparison information in diabetes management (and perhaps other chronic diseases) may improve motivation for self-care among some patients. A subset of patients, however, may benefit from guidance to focus on similarities with certain targets.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=25871344,1,1,0,0

Radiology 2005;235(3):775-790",2005,Performance benchmarks for diagnostic mammography,"PURPOSE: To evaluate a range of performance parameters pertinent to the comprehensive auditing of diagnostic mammography examinations, and to derive performance benchmarks therefrom, by pooling data collected from large numbers of patients and radiologists that are likely to be representative of mammography practice in the United States. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval was met, informed consent was not required, and this study was Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant. Six mammography registries contributed data to the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC), providing patient demographic and clinical information, mammogram interpretation data, and biopsy results from defined population-based catchment areas. The study involved 151 mammography facilities and 646 interpreting radiologists. The study population included women 18 years of age or older who underwent at least one diagnostic mammography examination between 1996 and 2001. Collected data were used to derive mean performance parameter values, including abnormal interpretation rate, positive predictive value (for abnormal interpretation, biopsy recommended, and biopsy performed), cancer diagnosis rate, invasive cancer size, and the percentages of minimal cancers, axillary node-negative invasive cancers, and stage 0 and I cancers. Additional benchmarks were derived for these performance parameters, including 10th, 25th, 50th (median), 75th, and 90th percentile values. RESULTS: The study involved 332,926 diagnostic mammography examinations. Mean performance parameter values were abnormal interpretation rate, 8.0%; positive predictive value for abnormal interpretation, 31.4%; positive predictive value for biopsy recommended, 31.5%; positive predictive value for biopsy performed, 39.5%; cancer diagnosis rate, 25.3 per 1000 examinations; invasive cancer size, 20.2 mm; percentage of minimal cancers, 42.0%; percentage of axillary node-negative invasive cancers, 73.6%; and percentage of stage 0 and I cancers, 62.4%.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval was obtained, and study was HIPAA compliant. Informed consent was or was not obtained according to institutional review board guidelines. Data from 188 mammographic facilities and 807 radiologists obtained between 1996 and 2002 were analyzed from six registries from the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC). Contributed data included demographic information, clinical findings, mammographic interpretation, and biopsy results. Measurements calculated were positive predictive values (PPVs) from screening mammography (PPV(1)), biopsy recommendation (PPV(2)), biopsy performed (PPV(3)), recall rate, cancer detection rate, mean cancer size, and cancer stage. Radiologist performance data are presented as 50th (median), 10th, 25th, 75th, and 90th percentiles and as graphic presentations by using smoothed curves. RESULTS: There were 2 580 151 screening mammographic studies from 1 117 390 women (age range, <30 to >/=80 years). The respective means and ranges of performance outcomes for the middle 50% of radiologists were as follows: recall rate, 9.8% and 6.4%-13.3%; PPV(1), 4.8% and 3.4%-6.2%; and PPV(2), 24.6% and 18.8%-32.0%. Mean cancer detection rate was 4.7 per 1000, and the mean size of invasive cancers was 13 mm. The range of performance outcomes for the middle 80% of radiologists also was presented.

We evaluated whether age, breast density, self-reported breast lump, and previous mammography influence the performance of diagnostic mammography. METHODS: From January 1996 through March 1998, prospective diagnostic mammography data from women aged 25-89 years with no previous breast cancer were linked to cancer outcomes data in six mammography registries participating in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. We used the final mammographic assessment at the end of the imaging work-up to determine abnormal mammographic examination rate, positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. We used age, breast density, prior mammogram, and self-reported breast lump jointly as predictors of performance. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Of 41 427 diagnostic mammograms, 6279 (15.2%) were judged abnormal. The overall PPV was 21.8%, sensitivity was 85.8%, and specificity was 87.7%. Multivariate analysis showed that sensitivity and specificity generally declined as breast density increased (P =.007 and P<.001, respectively), that previous mammography decreased sensitivity (odds ratio [OR] = 0.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.36 to 0.74; P<.001) but increased specificity (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.31 to 1.57; P<.001), and that a self-reported breast lump increased sensitivity (OR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.13 to 2.38; P =.013) but decreased specificity (OR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.49 to 0.59; P<.001).

OBJECTIVE: To compare the performance of screening mammography in women with a first-degree family history of breast cancer and women of similar age without such history. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Mammography registries in California (n = 1), New Hampshire (n = 1), New Mexico (n = 1), Vermont (n = 1), Washington State n = 2), and Colorado (n = 1). PARTICIPANTS: 389 533 women 30 to 69 years of age who were referred for screening mammography from April 1985 to November 1997. MEASUREMENTS: Risk factors for breast cancer; results of first screening examination captured for a woman by a registry; and any invasive cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ identified by linkage to a pathology database, the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, or a state tumor registry. RESULTS: The number of cancer cases per 1000 examinations increased with age and was higher in women with a family history of breast cancer than in those without (3.2 vs. 1.6 for ages 30 to 39 years, 4.7 vs. 2.7 for ages 40 to 49 years, 6.6 vs. 4.6 for ages 50 to 59 years, and 9.3 vs. 6.9 for ages 60 to 69 years).

However, only a few small older studies have examined Tv antibody persistence over time, all of which were composed mainly of female patients. Therefore, we examined Tv antibody persistence over time, as well as intra-individual variability, among middle- to older-aged men in the Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS). METHODS: We tested baseline and repeat plasma specimens (collected 1-3 years later) from 248 male participants for Tv antibodies. We used the same enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as in previous studies of Tv serostatus and PCa. RESULTS: At baseline, 46 (18.5 %) participants were seropositive for Tv infection. Seventy-six percent of these men were still seropositive 1-3 years later. A similar proportion of men ""seroconverted"" (4.0 %) as ""seroreverted"" (4.4 %), all of whom had absorbance values near the cutoff point for seropositivity. Overall, substantial agreement was observed between baseline and repeat serostatus (kappa = 0.72, 95 % confidence interval 0.60-0.83). CONCLUSION: Tv seropositivity was largely persistent between plasma specimens collected 1-3 years apart from middle- to older-aged men.

Gastroenterology 2015;149(6):1425-1437",2015,"Personalizing colonoscopy screening for elderly individuals based on screening history, cancer risk, and comorbidity status could increase cost effectiveness","BACKGROUND & AIMS: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening decisions for elderly individuals are often made primarily on the basis of age, whereas other factors that influence the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of screening are often not considered. We investigated the relative importance of factors that could be used to identify elderly individuals most likely to benefit from CRC screening and determined the maximum ages at which screening remains cost effective based on these factors. METHODS: We used a microsimulation model (Microsimulation Screening Analysis-Colon) calibrated to the incidence of CRC in the United States and the prevalence of adenomas reported in autopsy studies to determine the appropriate age at which to stop colonoscopy screening in 19,200 cohorts (of 10 million individuals), defined by sex, race, screening history, background risk for CRC, and comorbidity status. We applied a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: Less intensive screening history, higher background risk for CRC, and fewer comorbidities were associated with cost-effective screening at older ages. Sex and race had only a small effect on the appropriate age to stop screening. For some individuals likely to be screened in current practice (for example, 74-year-old white women with moderate comorbidities, half the average background risk for CRC, and negative findings from a screening colonoscopy 10 years previously), screening resulted in a loss of QALYs, rather than a gain. For some individuals unlikely to be screened in current practice (for example, 81-year-old black men with no comorbidities, an average background risk for CRC, and no previous screening), screening was highly cost effective. Although screening some previously screened, low-risk individuals was not cost effective even when they were 66 years old, screening some healthy, high-risk individuals remained cost effective until they reached the age of 88 years old. CONCLUSIONS: The current approach to CRC screening in elderly individuals, in which decisions are often based primarily on age, is inefficient, resulting in underuse of screening for some and overuse of screening for others. CRC screening could be more effective and cost effective if individual factors for each patient are considered.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Colorectal, Digestive Organs",Surveillance Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26253304,0,1,0,0

RESEARCH APPROACH: Individual audiotaped interviews lasting one to two hours. SETTING: Interviews in homes or workplaces or by telephone. PARTICIPANTS: 20 women with chronic mobility impairments who developed early-stage breast cancer prior to age 60. Three were recruited from oncologist panels and 17 from informal social networks of disabled women nationwide. METHODOLOGIC APPROACH: Qualitative analyses of interview transcripts to identify common themes. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Extent and nature of mobility impairments and concerns raised by patients about barriers to care. FINDINGS: The 20 participants identified issues with inaccessible equipment, including mammography machines, examining tables, and weight scales. The patients sometimes needed to insist on being transferred to an examining table when physicians preferred to examine them seated in their wheelchairs. When staff would transfer them, patients feared injury or felt badly when clinical personnel were injured during transfers. Other issues included difficulties with positioning and handling patients' uncontrollable movements. Even when clinical sites had accessible equipment, this equipment was sometimes unavailable for the appointment. CONCLUSIONS: Women with major mobility issues who developed breast cancer confronted numerous physical barriers during the course of their breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. INTERPRETATION: With the aging of the baby boomer generation, an increasing number of people with mobility impairments will be seeking healthcare services. Healthcare providers should be proactive in planning to accommodate these patients by considering accessibility whenever they acquire new equipment, renovate older structures, or build new facilities. They also should establish policies and procedures to ensure that equipment is available during appointments of patients with mobility issues and that staff are trained in safe transferring procedures. Ensuring accommodations and accessibility will benefit patients with impaired mobility and clinical staff.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Breast,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=21059583,0,1,0,0

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Physical activity and HRQOL data from 319 survivors of NHL (mean age, 59.8 years, standard deviation, +/-14.8) who were diagnosed in Los Angeles County approximately 2 to 5 years before the study was analyzed. RESULTS: One quarter of survivors of NHL met public health guidelines of 150 minutes or more of moderate to vigorous exercise per week. More than half (53%) reported some activity but less than 150 minutes per week, whereas 20% reported no physical activity. Females, those with lower perceived health competence, and individuals with more comorbid limitations were at increased risk for inactivity. Individuals who met public health guidelines reported better HRQOL than those who were sedentary. Interestingly, our findings suggest a significant positive association between HRQOL and those who get at least some exercise. CONCLUSION: The effort to promote physical activity among cancer survivors, who are at risk for poor quality of life as a result of treatment, is of great importance to the health of this growing population. As NHL, similar to other cancers, becomes a disease that people live with as opposed to one that people die as a result of, oncologists and primary care physicians will be increasingly challenged to provide evidence-based guidance for the long-term management of the patient's health.

Additionally, accelerometer metrics based on vertical axis counts and triaxial counts were compared. METHODS: This analysis included 684 women and 611 men age 43 to 83 yr. Participants wore the Actigraph GT3X on the hip for 7 d twice during the study and the average of the two measurements was used. Each participant also completed one DLW measurement, with a subset having a repeat. PAEE was estimated by subtracting resting metabolic rate and the thermic effect of food from total daily energy expenditure estimated by DLW. Partial Spearman correlations were used to estimate associations between PAEE and each accelerometer metric. RESULTS: Correlations between the accelerometer metrics and DLW-determined PAEE were higher for triaxial counts than vertical axis counts. After adjusting for weight, age, accelerometer wear time, and fat free mass, the correlation between TAC per day based on triaxial counts and DLW-determined PAEE was 0.44 in women and 0.41 in men. Correlations for steps per day and accelerometer-estimated PAEE with DLW-determined PAEE were similar. After adjustment for within-person variation in DLW-determined PAEE, the correlations for TAC per day increased to 0.61 and 0.49, respectively. Correlations between MVPA and DLW-determined PAEE were lower, particularly for modified bouts of >/=10 min. CONCLUSIONS: Accelerometer measures that represent total activity volume, including TAC per day, steps per day, and PAEE, were more highly correlated with DLW-determined PAEE than MVPA using traditional thresholds and should be considered by researchers seeking to reduce accelerometer data to a single metric.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=28419028,0,1,0,0

The Healthy Communities Study is a large-scale observational study of U.S. communities that is examining the characteristics of programs and policies designed to promote healthy behaviors (e.g., increase PA and improve diet) and determining their association with obesity-related outcomes. The purpose of this paper is to describe the methods used to measure PA in children and the personal and community factors that may influence it. The study used both self-reported and objective measures of PA, and measured personal, family, and home influences on PA via three constructs: (1) PA self-schema; (2) parental support; and (3) parental rules regarding PA. Neighborhood and community factors related to PA were assessed using three measures: (1) child perceptions of the neighborhood environment; (2) availability of PA equipment; and (3) attributes of the child's street segment via direct observation.

METHODS: We collected information on BMI and physical activity during a clinic visit 2 to 3 years after diagnosis. Weight and height were measured in a standard manner. Using an interview-administered questionnaire, participants recalled the type, duration, and frequency of physical activities they had performed in the last year. We estimated dense area and percentage density as a continuous measure using a computer-assisted software program from mammograms imaged approximately 1 to 2 years after diagnosis. Analysis of covariance methods were used to obtain mean density across WHO BMI categories and physical activity tertiles adjusted for confounders. RESULTS: We observed a statistically significant decline in percentage density (P for trend = .0001), and mammographic dense area (P for trend = .0052), with increasing level of BMI adjusted for potential covariates. We observed a statistically significant decline in mammographic dense area (P for trend = .036) with increasing level of sports/recreational physical activity in women with a BMI of at least 30 kg/m2. Conversely, in women with a BMI less than 25 kg/m2, we observed a non-statistically significant increase in mammographic dense area and percentage density with increasing level of sports/recreational physical activity.

This prospective study investigated physical activity (PA), occurrence of physical symptoms, and HRQOL in a large, ethnically-diverse cohort of breast cancer survivors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Survivors (n = 545), on average 6 months post-diagnosis, were assessed in person or by mail at baseline (retrospective reports of pre-diagnosis PA), at 29 months post-diagnosis (post-diagnosis PA), and at 39 months post-diagnosis (pain, hormone symptoms, sexual interest/dysfunction, fatigue, physical subscales of HRQOL). Linear regression and analysis of covariance assessed the relationships between pre- and post-diagnosis PA and PA change after cancer with symptoms and HRQOL. RESULTS: Greater pre-diagnosis PA was associated with better physical functioning at 39 months (betas 1.1-2.3; all p &lt; 0.01) but was generally unrelated to symptoms. Greater post-diagnosis sports/recreational PA was related to less fatigue and better physical functioning (betas -0.146, 2.21; both p &lt; 0.01).

While many studies have examined the extent to which physicians implement the guideline's ""5 A's"", few studies have examined the extent to which physicians implement the guideline's ""5 R's"" which are to be used in a Motivational Interviewing (MI) consistent style with smokers not ready to quit. This study examined the extent to which physicians in usual practice and without specific training administered the 5 R's including the use of an MI style. METHODS: Thirty-eight physicians were audio recorded during their routine clinical practice conversations with smokers.Recordings were coded by independent raters on the implementation of each of the 5 A's, 5 R's and MI counseling style. RESULTS: Results revealed that for patients not ready to quit smoking, physicians most frequently discussed the patient's personal relevance for quitting and the risks of smoking. Roadblocks and rewards were discussed relatively infrequently. MI skill code analyses revealed that physicians, on average, had moderate scores for acceptance and autonomy support, a low to moderate score for collaboration and low scores for empathy and evocation. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that for the Clinical Guideline to be implemented appropriately physicians will need specialized training or will need to be able to refer patients to counselors with the necessary expertise. Counseling efforts could increase providers' willingness to implement guideline recommendations and therefore to enhance the person-centeredness of clinical care.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26279853,0,0,1,0

Little is known about the physician visits of Medicare enrollees who are untested. Our study objective was to evaluate physician visits of enrollees who lack appropriate testing to identify opportunities to increase colorectal cancer testing. METHODS: We used North Carolina and South Carolina Medicare data to compare type and frequency of physician visits for Medicare enrollees with and without a colorectal cancer test in 2005. Type of physician visit was defined by the physician specialty as primary care, mixed specialty (more than 1 specialty, 1 of which was primary care), and nonprimary care. We used multivariate modeling to assess the influence of type and frequency of physician visits on colorectal cancer testing. RESULTS: Approximately half (46.5%) of enrollees lacked appropriate colorectal cancer testing. Among the untested group, 19.8% had no physician visits in 2005. Enrollees with primary care visits were more likely to be tested than those without a primary care visit. Many enrollees who had primary care visits remained untested. Enrollees with visits to all physician types had a greater likelihood of having colorectal cancer testing. CONCLUSION: We identified 3 categories of Medicare enrollees without appropriate colorectal cancer testing: those with no visits, those who see primary care physicians only, and those with multiple visits to physicians with primary and nonprimary care specialties.

The purpose of our study was to estimate per-physician annual volumes of mammography interpretation. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Our study includes 4.2 million mammography examinations performed at 196 facilities between 1998 and 2004. We calculated the annual interpretive volumes per physician, the proportion of mammography examinations interpreted by radiologists in specified volume categories, and the impact on mammography capacity if annual interpretive volume requirements increased. RESULTS: The mean annual mammographic interpretive volume was 1,777. Approximately 31% of radiologists interpreted < 1,000 mammography examinations annually, yet these low-volume radiologists interpreted only 10% of all mammograms. The 10% of radiologists who interpreted > or = 3,000 mammography examinations annually interpreted 32% of all examinations. Rural radiologists interpreted fewer examinations annually compared with urban radiologists. If the minimum annual volume requirement were increased to 1,000 mammograms per year, only 10% of the overall U.S. mammography capacity would be affected. If the requirement were increased to 2,000 mammograms annually, 47% of capacity would be eliminated, and a major rearrangement of workload would be required because most radiologists would no longer interpret enough examinations to meet the revised standards. CONCLUSION: Doubling physician annual volume requirements would result in a small impact on overall mammography capacity. Increasing volume requirements to 2,000 mammography examinations annually would require a dramatic increase in the number of mammography examinations interpreted by the higher volume radiologists. Unless previously low-volume radiologists increased their volumes, raising requirements to 2,000 examinations could curtail access to mammography, particularly in rural areas.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,"Office of the Associate Director, Applied Research Program",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=18212242,0,0,0,0

The objectives of this study were to determine the extent to which physicians' breast cancer surveillance testing beliefs are consistent with test overuse, and to identify factors associated with these beliefs. METHODS: During 2009-2010, a cross-sectional survey of US medical oncologists and primary care physicians (PCPs) was carried out. Physicians responded to a clinical vignette ascertaining beliefs about appropriate breast cancer surveillance testing. Multivariable analyses examined the extent to which test beliefs were consistent with overuse and associated with physician and practice characteristics and physician perceptions, attitudes, and practices. RESULTS: A total of 1098 medical oncologists and 980 PCPs completed the survey (response rate 57.5%). Eighty-four percent of PCPs [95% confidence interval (CI), 81.4%-86.5%] and 72% of oncologists (95% CI, 69.8%-74.7%) reported beliefs consistent with blood test overuse, whereas 50% of PCPs (95% CI, 47.3%-53.8%) and 27% of oncologists (95% CI, 23.9%-29.3%) reported beliefs consistent with imaging test overuse. Among PCPs, factors associated with these beliefs included smaller practice size, lower patient volume, and practice ownership. Among oncologists, factors included older age, international medical graduate status, lower self-efficacy (confidence in knowledge), and greater perceptions of ambiguity (conflicting expert recommendations) regarding survivorship care. CONCLUSIONS: Beliefs consistent with breast cancer surveillance test overuse are common, greater for PCPs and blood tests than for oncologists and imaging tests, and associated with practice characteristics and perceived self-efficacy and ambiguity about testing.

This article profiles patterns of discussion about and recommendations for screening and explores potential associations with multilevel factors (patient, clinician, practice, and environment). METHODS: In 2009, we analyzed data from 1,266 physicians responding to the 2006-2007 National Survey of Primary Care Physicians' Recommendations and Practices for Breast, Cervical, Colorectal, and Lung Cancer Screening (absolute response rate=69.3%; cooperation rate=75.0%). Descriptive statistics examined physicians' reports of discussion and recommendations. Multivariate analyses assessed the associations of these practices with multilevel factors. RESULTS: Although few respondents reported discussion of all options, 46% usually discuss more than one option; the vast majority of these respondents discuss fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) and colonoscopy (49%) or FOBT, sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy (32%). Of physicians who discuss more than one option, a majority reported usually recommending one or more test options, most commonly colonoscopy alone (43%) and FOBT and colonoscopy (43%). Several personal characteristics (specialty), perceived patient characteristics (prefer physician to decide), practice characteristics (geographic location), and community barriers (specialist availability) were independently associated with discussion and/or recommendation patterns. CONCLUSIONS: PCPs do not discuss the full menu of test options, but many report selecting one or two options for discussion and recommendation.

However, no prior US studies have evaluated the relation between GEP testing and the use of adjuvant chemotherapy by women treated in a general oncology practice. METHODS: Eligible patients were women under the age 65 of years who were newly diagnosed with their first stage I or II, hormone receptor-positive BC between 2006 and 2011 (n = 9405). This retrospective study was conducted with a data set consisting of registry data, health claims data, and GEP testing results. The distribution of GEP test results was reported in terms of the risk of recurrence predicted, and logistic regression was used to assess the association of test results with chemotherapy use, with adjustments made for multiple patient characteristics. RESULTS: The proportions of tested women with low, intermediate, and high recurrence score results were 51%, 39%, and 10%, respectively. Among these women, 11%, 47%, and 88%, respectively, received adjuvant chemotherapy. There was a significant, positive linear relation of assay scores with chemotherapy use within the low and intermediate subgroups after adjustments for all other factors (adjusted odds ratios, 1.17 and 1.20, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant chemotherapy use after GEP testing is generally consistent with the recommended test interpretation for women with a high or low predicted risk of recurrence. Chemotherapy use in the intermediate-risk group increased with Recurrence Score values, and evidence from ongoing randomized trials may help to clarify whether this finding reflects optimal interpretation of GEP test results.

Drawing upon experiences from a study of survivors of non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL), we discuss conceptual and methodological challenges to and opportunities for conducting population-based survivorship research using cancer registries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Survivors of aggressive NHL diagnosed between June 1998 and August 2001, 2-5 years prior to the study, were sampled from the Los Angeles Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registry. A conceptual framework was developed to systematically evaluate the association of sociodemographic, clinical, social, psychological, and behavioral factors with survivors' health-related quality of life. Data were collected primarily by a mailed questionnaire; medical records were also abstracted. RESULTS: Of 744 eligible survivors identified from the registry, 181 (24.3%) were lost to follow-up; 408 responded to the questionnaire (54.8%); 155 (20.8%) refused. Those lost to follow-up included a significantly higher proportion of younger, male, and Hispanic survivors compared to the other two groups (P &lt;or= 0.01).

We examined relative survival, the ratio of survival in cervical cancer patients to matched controls over time. STUDY DESIGN: Patients with cervical cancer diagnosed from 1983 through 2009 and recorded in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database were examined. Survival models were adjusted for age, race, stage, year of diagnosis, and time since diagnosis. Changes in stage-specific relative survival for patients with cervical cancer compared to the general population matched by age, race, and calendar year were examined over time. RESULTS: A total of 46,932 patients were identified. For women with stage I tumors, the excess hazard ratio for women diagnosed in 2009 was 0.91 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86-0.95) compared to 2000, 0.81 (95% CI, 0.73-0.91) compared to 1990, and 0.75 (95% CI, 0.64-0.88) compared to 1983. For patients with stage III tumors, the excess hazard ratios for patients diagnosed in 2009 (relative to those diagnosed in 2000, 1990, and 1983) were 0.83 (95% CI, 0.80-0.87), 0.68 (95% CI, 0.62-0.75), and 0.59 (95% CI, 0.52-0.68). Similar trends in improved survival over time were noted for women with stage II tumors.

Nicotine Tob Res 2015;17(11):1385-1392",2015,Positive psychotherapy for smoking cessation: a pilot randomized controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE: Greater depressive symptoms and low positive affect (PA) are associated with poor smoking cessation outcomes. Smoking cessation approaches that incorporate a focus on PA may benefit smokers trying to quit. The purpose of this study was to conduct a pilot randomized clinical trial to compare standard smoking cessation treatment (ST) with smoking cessation treatment that targets positive affect, termed positive psychotherapy for smoking cessation (PPT-S). METHOD: Smokers who were seeking smoking cessation treatment were assigned by urn randomization to receive, along with 8 weeks of nicotine replacement therapy, either ST (n = 31) or PPT-S (n = 35). Seven-day point prevalence smoking abstinence was biochemically confirmed at 8, 16, and 26 weeks. RESULTS: Compared to ST, a greater percentage of participants in PPT-S were abstinent at 8 weeks, 16 weeks, and 26 weeks, but these differences were nonsignificant. In a more statistically powerful longitudinal model, participants in PPT-S had a significantly higher odds of abstinence (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.75; 95% CI = 1.02, 7.42; p = .046) across follow-ups compared to those in ST. The positive effect of PPT-S was stronger for those higher in PA (OR = 6.69, 95% CI = 1.16, 38.47, p = .03). Greater use of PPT-S strategies during the initial 8 weeks of quitting was associated with a less steep decline in smoking abstinence rates over time (OR = 2.64, 95% CI = 1.06, 6.56, p =.04). CONCLUSION: This trial suggests substantial promise for incorporating PPT into smoking cessation treatment.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=25646352,0,0,0,1

Breast Cancer Res Treat 2007;106(1):85-95",2007,Possible socioeconomic and ethnic disparities in quality of life in a cohort of breast cancer survivors,"BACKGROUND: This paper describes the ethnic and socioeconomic correlates of functioning in a cohort of long-term nonrecurring breast cancer survivors. METHODS: Participants (n = 804) in this study were women from the Health, Eating, Activity, and Lifestyle (HEAL) Study, a population-based, multicenter, multiethnic, prospective study of women newly diagnosed with in situ or Stages I to IIIA breast cancer. Measurements occurred at three timepoints following diagnosis. Outcomes included standardized measures of functioning (MOS SF-36). RESULTS: Overall, these long-term survivors reported values on two physical function subscales of the SF-36 slightly lower than population norms. Black women reported statistically significantly lower physical functioning (PF) scores (P = 0.01), compared with White and Hispanic women, but higher mental health (MH) scores (P < 0.01) compared with White and Hispanic women. In the final adjusted model, race was significantly related to PF, with Black participants and participants in the 'Other' ethnic category reporting poorer functioning compared to the White referent group (P < 0.01, 0.05). Not working outside the home, being retired or disabled and being unemployed (on leave, looking for work) were associated with poorer PF compared to currently working (both P < 0.01).

Lymphology 2010;43(3):118-127",2010,Post-breast cancer lymphedema: incidence increases from 12 to 30 to 60 months,"Breast cancer survivors are at life-time risk of developing lymphedema (LE). Quantification of LE has been problematic as the criteria used to identify lymphedema use various methods to assess changes in the volume of the affected limb. In part because of difficulties and variability in measurement and diagnosis, the reported incidence of LE varies greatly among women treated with surgery and radiation for breast cancer. The goal of this research was to describe the trends for LE occurrence over three points in time (12, 30, and 60 months) among breast cancer survivors using four diagnostic criteria based on three measurement techniques. Participants were enrolled following diagnosis of breast cancer but before surgery. Baseline limb volume and symptom assessment data were obtained. Participants were followed every 3 months for 12 months, then every 6 months thereafter for a total of 60 months. Limb volume changes (LVC) in both limbs were measured using three techniques: objectively by (a) circumferences at 4 cm intervals and (b) perometry and subjectively by (c) symptom experience via interview. Four diagnostic criteria for LE most often reported in the literature were used: (i) 2 cm circumferential change; (ii) 200 mL perometry LVC; (iii) 10% perometry LVC; and (iv) signs and symptoms (SS) report of limb heaviness and swelling, either 'now' or 'in the past year' (diagnostic criteria i-iii define increases/differences in limb volume from baseline and/or between the affected and non-affected limb). Standard survival analysis methods were applied to identify when the criteria corresponding to LE were met. Trends in LE occurrence are reported for preliminary analysis of data from 236 participants collected at 6-, 12-, 18-, 24-, 30-, and 60-months post-op. At 60 months post-treatment, LE incidence using the four criteria ranged from 43% to 94%, with 2 cm associated with the highest frequency for lymphedema occurrence and SS the lowest. Sixty-month trends are compared to earlier trends at 12- and 30-months, per criterion. These preliminary findings provide additional evidence that breast cancer survivors are at risk for developing LE beyond the first year following treatment. Cases of lymphedema continue to emerge through 60-months post-breast cancer surgery. This 60-month analysis supports the previous 12- and 30-month analyses in finding the 2 cm criteria to be the most liberal definition of LE. The self-report of heaviness and swelling, along with 10% LVC, represent the most conservative definitions (41% and 45%, respectively). Furthermore, the variety of criteria used to identify LE, along with the absence of baseline (pre-treatment) measurements, likely contribute to the wide range of LE incidence rates reported in the literature.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Breast,Office of Cancer Survivorship,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=21226414,0,1,0,0

Am J Clin Nutr 2015;102(5):1134-1141",2015,Postdiagnostic intake of one-carbon nutrients and alcohol in relation to colorectal cancer survival,"BACKGROUND: Observational data have suggested that intakes of nutrients involved in one-carbon metabolism are inversely associated with risk of colorectal carcinoma and adenomas. In contrast, results from some preclinical studies and cardiovascular and chemoprevention trials have raised concerns that high folate intake may promote carcinogenesis by facilitating the progression of established neoplasia. OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that higher total folate intake (including food folate and folic acid from fortified foods and supplements) or other one-carbon nutrient intakes might be associated with poorer survival after a diagnosis of colorectal cancer. DESIGN: We used rectal and colon cancer cases within the following 2 US prospective cohort studies: the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. Biennial questionnaires were used to gather information on medical history and lifestyle factors, including smoking and alcohol consumption. B-vitamin and methionine intakes were derived from food-frequency questionnaires. Data on tumor molecular characteristics (including microsatellite instability, CpG island methylator phenotype, KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations, and long interspersed nucleotide element 1 methylation level) were available for a subset of cases. We assessed colorectal cancer-specific mortality according to postdiagnostic intakes of one-carbon nutrients with the use of multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models. RESULTS: In 1550 stage I-III colorectal cancer cases with a median follow-up of 14.9 y, we documented 641 deaths including 176 colorectal cancer-specific deaths. No statistically significant associations were observed between postdiagnostic intakes of folate or other one-carbon nutrients and colorectal cancer-specific mortality (multivariate P-trend >/= 0.21). In an exploratory molecular pathologic epidemiology survival analysis, there was no significant interaction between one-carbon nutrients or alcohol and any of the tumor molecular biomarkers examined. CONCLUSIONS: Higher postdiagnostic intakes of one-carbon nutrients are not associated with the prognosis in stage I-III colorectal cancer.

Surveillance is frequently over- and under-recommend, resulting in strained colonoscopy capacity, potential risks without expected benefits, and missed opportunities for colorectal cancer risk reduction. AIMS: To identify factors associated with adherence to post-polypectomy surveillance guidelines. METHODS: We conducted a three-phase study with a retrospective review of usual care post-polypectomy surveillance recommendations through medical chart abstraction (Phase I), prospective online physician survey (Phase II), and analysis of survey-based and other physician-based predictors of usual care surveillance recommendations (Phase III). Subjects included patients who underwent usual care colonoscopy 2011-2012 (Phases I and III) and gastroenterology (GI) attendings and fellows (Phases II and III). We identified rates of recommendations consistent with guideline adherence, surveillance overuse, and surveillance underuse based on usual care medical chart documentation and physician survey, as well as predictors of physician adherence to guidelines. RESULTS: We reviewed 640 patient charts for 28 survey respondents. Rates of usual practice recommendations consistent with guideline adherence, surveillance overutilization, and underutilization were 84, 13, and 3%, respectively. At survey, 82% of physicians were concerned about missed cancer. Eleven percentage believed that guidelines were not aggressive enough. GI trainees were 2.5 times more likely to issue guideline-adherent recommendations [OR 2.5, 95% CI (1.5-4.2)]. Disagreement with guideline aggressiveness was independently associated with 40% lower likelihood of adherence [OR 0.6, 95% CI (0.4-0.8)].

OBJECTIVE: To identify mechanisms for cancer resistance in elephants and compare cellular response to DNA damage among elephants, healthy human controls, and cancer-prone patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A comprehensive survey of necropsy data was performed across 36 mammalian species to validate cancer resistance in large and long-lived organisms, including elephants (n = 644). The African and Asian elephant genomes were analyzed for potential mechanisms of cancer resistance. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from elephants, healthy human controls, and patients with LFS were tested in vitro in the laboratory for DNA damage response. The study included African and Asian elephants (n = 8), patients with LFS (n = 10), and age-matched human controls (n = 11). Human samples were collected at the University of Utah between June 2014 and July 2015. EXPOSURES: Ionizing radiation and doxorubicin. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cancer mortality across species was calculated and compared by body size and life span. The elephant genome was investigated for alterations in cancer-related genes. DNA repair and apoptosis were compared in elephant vs human peripheral blood lymphocytes. RESULTS: Across mammals, cancer mortality did not increase with body size and/or maximum life span (eg, for rock hyrax, 1% [95% CI, 0%-5%]; African wild dog, 8% [95% CI, 0%-16%]; lion, 2% [95% CI, 0%-7%]). Despite their large body size and long life span, elephants remain cancer resistant, with an estimated cancer mortality of 4.81% (95% CI, 3.14%-6.49%), compared with humans, who have 11% to 25% cancer mortality. While humans have 1 copy (2 alleles) of TP53, African elephants have at least 20 copies (40 alleles), including 19 retrogenes (38 alleles) with evidence of transcriptional activity measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. In response to DNA damage, elephant lymphocytes underwent p53-mediated apoptosis at higher rates than human lymphocytes proportional to TP53 status (ionizing radiation exposure: patients with LFS, 2.71% [95% CI, 1.93%-3.48%] vs human controls, 7.17% [95% CI, 5.91%-8.44%] vs elephants, 14.64% [95% CI, 10.91%-18.37%]; P < .001; doxorubicin exposure: human controls, 8.10% [95% CI, 6.55%-9.66%] vs elephants, 24.77% [95% CI, 23.0%-26.53%]; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Compared with other mammalian species, elephants appeared to have a lower-than-expected rate of cancer, potentially related to multiple copies of TP53. Compared with human cells, elephant cells demonstrated increased apoptotic response following DNA damage. These findings, if replicated, could represent an evolutionary-based approach for understanding mechanisms related to cancer suppression.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26447779,1,1,0,0

Genet Epidemiol 2015;39(8):609-618",2015,Powerful set-based gene-environment interaction testing framework for complex diseases,"Identification of gene-environment interaction (G x E) is important in understanding the etiology of complex diseases. Based on our previously developed Set Based gene EnviRonment InterAction test (SBERIA), in this paper we propose a powerful framework for enhanced set-based G x E testing (eSBERIA). The major challenge of signal aggregation within a set is how to tell signals from noise. eSBERIA tackles this challenge by adaptively aggregating the interaction signals within a set weighted by the strength of the marginal and correlation screening signals. eSBERIA then combines the screening-informed aggregate test with a variance component test to account for the residual signals. Additionally, we develop a case-only extension for eSBERIA (coSBERIA) and an existing set-based method, which boosts the power not only by exploiting the G-E independence assumption but also by avoiding the need to specify main effects for a large number of variants in the set. Through extensive simulation, we show that coSBERIA and eSBERIA are considerably more powerful than existing methods within the case-only and the case-control method categories across a wide range of scenarios.

METHODS: We collected information on PA during an interview administered at a baseline visit scheduled within the first year after diagnosis. Participants recalled the type, duration, and frequency of different PAs for the year prior to their diagnosis. Dense area and percent density were estimated, from mammograms imaged approximately 1 year before diagnosis, as a continuous measure using a computer-assisted software program. Analysis of covariance methods were used to obtain mean density across PA tertiles adjusted for confounders. We stratified analyses by menopausal status and body mass index (BMI) because these factors strongly influence density.

First, we evaluated the 2SFCA method in relation to traditional methods. We then examined the impact of access to mammography centers and primary care on late-stage breast cancer diagnosis and receipt of adjuvant hormonal therapy. METHODS: Cancer registries from Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kentucky, and North Carolina were linked with Medicare data to identify the stage of breast cancer diagnosis for Appalachia women diagnosed between 2006 and 2008. Women eligible for adjuvant therapy had stage I, II, or III diagnosis; mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery; and hormone receptor-positive breast cancers.

RESULTS: Over 21% of 15,299 women diagnosed with breast cancer had late-stage (stages III-IV) diagnosis.

Little is known about predictors of phthalate exposure, particularly in Asian countries. Because phthalates are rapidly metabolized and excreted from the body following exposure, it is important to evaluate whether phthalate metabolites measured at a single point in time can reliably rank exposures to phthalates over a period of time. We examined the concentrations and predictors of phthalate metabolite concentrations among 50 middle-aged women and 50 men from two Shanghai cohorts, enrolled in 1997-2000 and 2002-2006, respectively. We assessed the reproducibility of urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites in three spot samples per participant taken several years apart (mean interval between first and third sample was 7.5 years [women] or 2.9 years [men]), using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients and intra-class correlation coefficients. We detected ten phthalate metabolites in at least 50% of individuals for two or more samples. Participant sex, age, menopausal status, education, income, body mass index, consumption of bottled water, recent intake of medication, and time of day of collection of the urine sample were associated with concentrations of certain phthalate metabolites. The reproducibility of an individual's urinary concentration of phthalate metabolites across several years was low, with all intra-class correlation coefficients and most Spearman rank correlation coefficients </=0.3. Only mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, a metabolite of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, had a Spearman rank correlation coefficient >/=0.4 among men, suggesting moderate reproducibility. These findings suggest that a single spot urine sample is not sufficient to rank exposures to phthalates over several years in an adult urban Chinese population.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26255822,0,1,0,1

We determined which demographic and clinical factors predict overall and cancer specific survival with this treatment strategy in patients enrolled in the Prostate Cancer Outcomes Study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 1994 to 1995 the Prostate Cancer Outcomes Study recruited 3,533 men diagnosed with prostate cancer. Clinical and treatment information was abstracted from medical records and demographic characteristics were obtained from patient surveys 6, 12, 24 and 60 months after diagnosis. Overall and cancer specific mortality was analyzed through December 2002 using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression. RESULTS: A total of 276 patients had organ confined (cT1-2) prostatic adenocarcinoma and received primary androgen suppression therapy within 1 year of diagnosis. Median followup for censored patients was 7.6 years (range 1.1 to 8.1). Five-year overall and cancer specific survival was 66% (95% CI 59-72) and 91% (95% CI 86-94), respectively.

CBE sensitivity increased with larger tumor size (17% for tumors < or = 0.5 cm and 58% for tumors > or = 2.1 cm, adjusted p for trend < 0.001) and decreased with higher body weight (48 and 23% for the lowest and highest quartiles, adjusted p for trend < 0.001). CBE was more sensitive in Asian women compared to white women (88% v.s. 35%, adjusted p = 0.04) and in current users of estrogen and progesterone combination therapy compared to never/former users (52% v.s. 33%, adjusted p = 0.08). There was an inverted U-shaped association between age and CBE sensitivity (40-49: 26%, 50-59: 48%, 60-69: 36%, 70-79: 33%, 80+: 18%, significant for oldest and youngest groups v.s. age 50-59 years).

Integr Cancer Ther 2013;12(3):225-235",2013,Predictors of use of complementary and alternative medicine by non-Hodgkin lymphoma survivors and relationship to quality of life,"HYPOTHESES: This study hypothesized that non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients who used complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) would have higher health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and a greater perceived sense of control than nonusers. However, since CAM may predict HRQOL, and perceived control may be both associated with CAM use as well as being an independent predictor of HRQOL, the authors also sought to test whether perceived control mediated the relationship between CAM use and HRQOL. STUDY DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study design. NHL survivors diagnosed between June 1, 1998 and August 31, 2001 were selected from the population-based SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) cancer registry for Los Angeles County and were mailed a survey in 2003 that assessed CAM use and predictors of CAM use. The response rate was 54.8%; 319 provided complete data for analysis. METHODS: Categories of CAM were defined according to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine guidelines. The authors measured survivors' cancer-related control using the Perceived Personal Control scale, a 4-question scale that was adapted from previously validated scales. HRQOL was measured using the mental component summary and physical component summary scores from the SF-36 v2.0. Bivariate and multivariable logistic and linear regression models were used to assess factors associated with CAM use and the association of CAM use with psychosocial health outcomes, respectively. RESULTS: Sixty-one percent of respondents reported using at least one CAM modality within the past 4 weeks, and 40% did so after excluding personal prayer and support groups. Younger age and higher education were significantly associated with greater CAM use as were higher perception of cancer-related control (P = .004) and more positive mental functioning (P = .016). Perception of control significantly mediated the association between CAM use and mental functioning (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: CAM use may be related to more positive mental health-related quality of life by increasing patients' perception of perceived control over their health; however, cause and effect cannot be determined.

We examined whether differences in hormonal therapy adherence may be at least partially explained by the availability of prescription drug coverage. Women aged 20-79 years diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer between June 2005 and February 2007 were enrolled in the study. Women completed a mailed survey, on average 9 months after diagnosis, and again approximately 4 years later (N = 712). Adjusted logistic regression was used to predict the likelihood of initiating hormonal therapy and hormonal therapy continuation. Women who had prescription drug coverage were more likely to initiate hormonal therapy relative to women without prescription drug coverage (OR 2.91, 95 % CI 1.24-6.84). Women with prescription drug coverage were also more likely to continue hormonal therapy (OR 2.23; 95 % CI 0.99-5.05, p = 0.0543). The lowest income women were also less likely to continue hormonal therapy relative to women with annual household income that exceeded $70,000 (OR 0.55; 95 % CI 0.29-1.04) with a borderline significance of (p = 0.08). This study demonstrates the critical role of prescription drug coverage in hormonal therapy initiation and continuation, independent of health insurance coverage. These findings add to the body of literature that addresses medication adherence. Financial factors must be considered along with behavioral factors that influence adherence, which is becoming increasingly relevant to oncology as treatments are shifted to oral medications, many of which are very expensive.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Breast,Healthcare Delivery Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26553168,0,1,0,1

Cancer Epidemiol 2010;34(2):168-177",2010,Prevalence and correlates of recent and repeat mammography among California women ages 55-79,"OBJECTIVE: Data on repeat mammography rates are less available than for recent screening. Two large, population-based state surveys provide the opportunity to investigate repeat and recent mammography prevalence and correlates among California's diverse population. METHODS: Data were from women aged 55-79, using the 2001 and 2005 California Health Interview Surveys. The study assessed the prevalence and correlates of recent mammography (within the past two years) and repeat mammography (mammogram within the past two years and 3-11 mammograms within the past six years). RESULTS: Prevalence was 82.4% (recent) and 73.8% (repeat) in 2001, and 87.1% (recent) and 77.5% (repeat) in 2005. Correlates of lower rates were insurance status, no usual source of care, being a smoker, age 65-79, being Asian with no English proficiency, being never married, and lower absolute risk for breast cancer. Especially low ratios of repeat-to-recent mammography existed for the uninsured, and those using the emergency room or with no source of care. Unexpected findings in which unadjusted results were inconsistent with multivariable adjusted results occurred for Latinas with no English proficiency and women at 200-299% of poverty level.

It is now important to expand the attention given to obtaining repeat examination. This study examines the prevalence and cross-sectional correlates of repeat mammography, among women aged 55-79, using a 12-month (N = 3,502) and a 24-month interval (N = 3,491). METHODS: Data were from the Year 2000 Cancer Control Module of the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS-CCM). The NHIS-CCM asked about the most recent mammogram and the total number of mammograms over the prior 6 years. An algorithm estimated repeat mammography for the two intervals. RESULTS: Prevalence estimates were 49% for the 12-month interval, and 64.1% for the 24-month interval. Correlates of lower likelihood of repeat mammography for both indicators were: no regular source of care, having public or no health insurance, less than a college education, household income less than $45K, not being married, current or never smoking, age 65-79, and lower absolute risk of breast cancer (Gail Model score). CONCLUSIONS: A substantial percentage of women do not receive repeat mammography. The correlates of repeat mammography were similar to those often found for ever-had and recent mammography.

Guidelines for clinical skin exam for improving early diagnosis of melanoma remain inconsistent, and current data on factors associated with regular skin screening on a population basis are limited. METHODS: We used self-reported data from 50,044 members of the California Twin Program, a population-based cohort of twins born in California between 1908 and 1982, to identify prevalence and determinants of recent clinical screening for skin cancer. RESULTS: Prevalence of skin examination was higher than national estimates, with 32% of respondents of all ages reporting ever having skin examination. Sociodemographic and constitutional risk factors including white race, educational attainment, marital status, and number of large moles were strongly associated with recent screening, as were individual and family history of skin cancer. Lower socioeconomic status, racial/ethnic minority status, and paradoxically, frequent UV-related risk behaviors in adulthood were associated with a lower likelihood of recent screening. CONCLUSIONS: As the evidence concerning the efficacy of skin examination continues to evolve, attention should be paid to motivators and barriers of screening, particularly in high-risk subgroups where lack of screening may contribute to disparate rates of thicker melanomas and lower survival.

METHODS: A total of 471 breast cancer patients from western Washington State and New Mexico who participated in the prospective Health, Eating, Activity, and Lifestyle Study were included in this study. Appendicular lean mass was measured using dual X-ray absorptiometry scans at study inception, on average, 12 months after diagnosis. Sarcopenia was defined as two standard deviations below the young healthy adult female mean of appendicular lean mass divided by height squared (<5.45 kg/m(2)). Total and breast-cancer-specific mortality data were obtained from Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results registries. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models assessed the associations between sarcopenia and mortality. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 9.2 years; 75 women were classified as sarcopenic, and among 92 deaths, 46 were attributed to breast cancer. In multivariable models that included age, race-ethnicity/study site, treatment type, comorbidities, waist circumference, and total body fat percentage, sarcopenia was independently associated with overall mortality (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.86; 95 % CI, 1.67-4.89). Sarcopenic women had increased risk of breast-cancer-specific mortality, although the association was not statistically significant (HR = 1.95, 95 % CI, 0.87-4.35). CONCLUSION: Sarcopenia is associated with an increased risk of overall mortality in breast cancer survivors and may be associated with breast-cancer-specific mortality.

The objective of this study was to examine the impact of primary care and economic barriers to health care on CRC testing relative to the 2001 Medicare expansion of screening coverage. METHODS: Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey data were use to study community-dwelling enrollees aged 65 to 80 years, free of renal disease and CRC, and who participated in the survey in 2000 (n = 8,330), 2003 (n = 7,889), or 2005 (n = 7,614). Three outcomes were examined: colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy within 5 years (recent endoscopy), endoscopy more than 5 years previously, and fecal occult blood test (FOBT) within 2 years. RESULTS: Endoscopy use increased and FOBT use decreased during the 6-year period, with no significant independent differences between those receiving care from primary care physicians and those receiving care from other physicians. Beneficiaries without a usual place of health care were the least likely to undergo CRC testing, and that gap widened with time: adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.27 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.19-0.39) for FOBT, and AOR = 0.35 (95% CI, 0.27-0.46) for endoscopy in 2000 compared with AOR = 0.18 (95% CI, 0.11-0.30) for FOBT and AOR = 0.22 (95% CI, 0.17-0.30) for endoscopy in 2005. Disparities in use of recent endoscopy by type of health insurance coverage in both 2000 and 2005 were greater for enrollees with a high school education or higher than they were for less-educated enrollees. There were no statistically significant differences by delayed care due to cost after adjustment for health insurance. CONCLUSION: Despite expanding coverage for screening, complex CRC screening disparities persisted based on differences in the usual place and cost of health care, type of health insurance coverage, and level of education.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Colorectal,Healthcare Delivery Research Program,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20644184,0,1,0,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 53 melanoma patients were accrued to 2 trials (June 2005 to July 2008) that included prospective evaluations of postoperative complications; 30-day wound complications included infection, seroma, and/or dehiscence. There were 20 patients who underwent limb volume measurement and completed a 19-item lymphedema symptom assessment questionnaire preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively. A multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate potential risk factors for complications. A microcosting analysis was also performed to evaluate the direct costs associated with wound complications. RESULTS: The 30-day wound complications were noted in 77.4% of patients. A BMI >/= 30 (n = 28) increased the risk for wound complications (odds ratio [OR] = 11.4, 95% confidence interval [95%CI] 1.6-78.5, P = .01), while advanced nodal disease approached significance (OR = 9.0, 95%CI: 0.79-103.1, P = .08).

Costs for patients with wound complications were significantly higher than for those without wound complications. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative wound complications and early onset lymphedema occur frequently following ILND for melanoma.

We used prospective risk information to predict a diagnosis of breast cancer in a cohort of 1 million women undergoing screening mammography. METHODS: There were 2,392,998 eligible screening mammograms from women without previously diagnosed breast cancer who had had a prior mammogram in the preceding 5 years. Within 1 year of the screening mammogram, 11,638 women were diagnosed with breast cancer. Separate logistic regression risk models were constructed for premenopausal and postmenopausal examinations by use of a stringent (P<.0001) criterion for the inclusion of risk factors. Risk models were constructed with 75% of the data and validated with the remaining 25%. Concordance of the predicted with the observed outcomes was assessed by a concordance (c) statistic after logistic regression model fit. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Statistically significant risk factors for breast cancer diagnosis among premenopausal women included age, breast density, family history of breast cancer, and a prior breast procedure. For postmenopausal women, the statistically significant factors included age, breast density, race, ethnicity, family history of breast cancer, a prior breast procedure, body mass index, natural menopause, hormone therapy, and a prior false-positive mammogram. The model may identify high-risk women better than the Gail model, although predictive accuracy was only moderate.

Responses of 'completely,' 'very,' or 'native speaker' were combined into 'comfortable speaking English': all other responses were categorized as 'less comfortable speaking English.' Those comfortable speaking English reported higher trust for health information from newspapers (p < .05), magazines (p < .05), and the Internet (p < .01) compared with those less comfortable speaking English. They also reported more media exposure: daily hours listening to the radio and watching television (both p < .05) and days per week reading newspapers (p < .05). Hispanics comfortable speaking English reported much higher levels of Internet use (54% versus 14%, p < .0001). Hispanics who are not comfortable speaking English may be difficult to reach, not only because of language barriers and lower trust in media, but also because they report relatively little use of various media channels.

Participants included 126 women considering genetic testing. Questionnaires were administered prior to testing, one week, three and six months after result disclosure. Results indicated no systematic effects of testing based on personal cancer history. Mutation carriers and women who elected not to be tested reported greater perceived risk and intrusive and avoidant thoughts at follow-up time points than did women who received negative (uninformative) or variant results. Mutation carriers reported more distress at the three-month follow-up but by six months the effects of test result on distress dissipated and groups were comparable. Cluster analyses identified two groups of individuals based on distress at baseline; these groups were used to predict psychological outcomes after testing. Distress remained constant in both groups: those who were high at baseline remained high and those who were low remained low. Test results did not moderate this effect. Results suggest that genetic testing for BRCA1/2 does not increase distress or have deleterious effects on quality of life over the long term. However, sub-groups of women may report more distress over time.

This study evaluated the psychometric properties of a shortened version of the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (BCPT) symptom checklist in a sample of 803 breast cancer survivors. Principal factor analysis with Promax oblique rotation revealed a five-factor structure, identifying five separate hormone-related symptoms scales: vasomotor symptoms, urinary incontinence, cognitive/mood changes, vaginal symptoms, and weight gain/appearance concern. Hormone-related symptom scale scores differed by demographic and clinical characteristics according to expectations, suggesting that these five scales from the shortened BCPT checklist are reasonably reliable and valid. Symptom scale scores were only weakly correlated with health-related quality of life scores; however, the pattern of results generally supported the validity of the symptom scales.

Data were obtained from the nationally representative 2013 U.S. Health Information National Trends Survey. Guided by a social-cognitive conceptual framework, univariable and multivariable logistic regressions were conducted to identify factors associated with awareness of DTC genetic tests. Of 3185 participants, 35.6% were aware of DTC genetic tests, with the majority learning about these tests through radio, television, and the Internet. In the final adjusted model, participants with annual incomes of $99,999 or less had lower odds of being aware of DTC genetic testing (ORs ranging from 0.46-0.61) than did those participants with incomes of $100,000 or more. The odds of awareness of DTC genetic tests were significantly higher for those who actively seek cancer information (OR=1.91, 95% CI=1.36-2.69), use the Internet (OR=1.81, 95% CI=1.05-3.13), and have high numeracy skills (OR=1.67, 95% CI=1.17-2.38).

Cancer 2015;121(13):2281-2285",2015,Public health impact of achieving 80% colorectal cancer screening rates in the United States by 2018,"BACKGROUND: The National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable, a national coalition of public, private, and voluntary organizations, has recently announced an initiative to increase colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates in the United States to 80% by 2018. The authors evaluated the potential public health benefits of achieving this goal. METHODS: The authors simulated the 1980 through 2030 United States population of individuals aged 50 to 100 years using microsimulation modeling. Test-specific historical screening rates were based on National Health Interview Survey data for 1987 through 2013. The effects of increasing screening rates from approximately 58% in 2013 to 80% in 2018 were compared to a scenario in which the screening rate remained approximately constant. The outcomes were cancer incidence and mortality rates and numbers of CRC cases and deaths during short-term follow-up (2013-2020) and extended follow-up (2013-2030). RESULTS: Increasing CRC screening rates to 80% by 2018 would reduce CRC incidence rates by 17% and mortality rates by 19% during short-term follow-up and by 22% and 33%, respectively, during extended follow-up. These reductions would amount to a total of 277,000 averted new cancers and 203,000 averted CRC deaths from 2013 through 2030. CONCLUSIONS: Achieving the goal of increasing the uptake of CRC screening in the United States to 80% by 2018 may have a considerable public health impact by averting approximately 280,000 new cancer cases and 200,000 cancer deaths within <20 years.

Tob Control 2015;24",2015,Public opinion about FDA regulation of menthol and nicotine,"OBJECTIVE: Regulations that reduce nicotine and eliminate menthol in cigarettes have been proposed to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as product alterations that could reduce smoking prevalence in the USA. This study sought to assess the public response to either action. METHODS: A mail survey of a representative sample of 1074 adults was conducted in two major metropolitan areas to determine the level of support for immediate, gradual or no reduction of menthol and nicotine in cigarettes. RESULTS: There was more support for reducing nicotine (79%) than for reducing or removing menthol (59.5%). Most smokers (59.2%; 95% CI 50.7 to 67.2) and 36% of non-smokers (95% CI 31.7 to 40.8) opposed eliminating menthol, but few smokers (23.8%) or non-smokers (20.3%) were opposed to reducing nicotine. Logistic regression showed no significant effect of smoking status on support for reductions in nicotine, but that smokers were significantly less supportive than non-smokers of FDA action on menthol (OR=0.32, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.49). A significant race by smoking status interaction showed that African-American smokers were more supportive of removing menthol than non-African-American smokers. CONCLUSIONS: The greater smoker support for reductions in nicotine than menthol could be due to inaccurate beliefs about the disease risk associated with the two substances (ie, a belief that nicotine is more harmful than menthol), or to greater awareness of the sensory role that menthol plays in smokers' satisfaction. In any case, if FDA goes ahead with regulations to remove menthol, it will be important to develop strategies to reduce smoker resistance.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=24638964,0,1,0,0

Previous studies have documented variation across physicians in colonoscopy quality as measured by the adenoma detection rate (ADR). ADR is the primary quality measure of colonoscopy examinations and an indicator of the likelihood of subsequent colorectal cancer. There is interest in mechanisms to improve the ADR. In Central Illinois, a local employer and a quality improvement organization partnered to publically report physician colonoscopy quality. OBJECTIVE: We assessed whether this initiative was associated with an improvement in the ADR. DESIGN: We compared ADRs before and after public reporting at a private practice endoscopy center with 11 gastroenterologists in Peoria, Illinois, who participated in the initiative. To generate the ADR, colonoscopy and pathology reports from examinations performed over 4 years at the endoscopy center were analyzed by using previously validated natural language processing software. SETTING: A central Illinois endoscopy center. RESULTS: The ADR in the pre-public reporting period was 34.3% and 39.2% in the post-public reporting period (an increase of 4.9%, P < .001). The increase in the right-sided ADR was 5.1% (P < .01), whereas the increase in the left-sided ADR was 2.1% (P < .05). The increase in the ADR was 7.8% for screening colonoscopies (P < 0.05) and 3.5% for nonscreening colonoscopies (P < .05). All but 1 physician's ADR increased (range -2.7% to 10.5%). There was no statistically significant change in the advanced ADR (increase of 0.8%, P = .22). LIMITATIONS: There was no concurrent control group to assess whether the increased ADR was due to a secular trend.

METHODS: Women were eligible if they were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ 5 to 10 years before June 30, 1998 and were enrolled at Group Health Cooperative, a health maintenance organization in western Washington State. A questionnaire was mailed to 290 women; 216 were included in this analysis. The questionnaire included standardized measures of QOL [e.g., the Cancer Rehabilitation Evaluation System (CARES-SF) and SF-36] as well as general demographic and medical information. ANOVA and logistic regression were used to estimate correlates of self-reported QOL. RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 44.4 years, and the average time since diagnosis was 7.3 years. Women reported high levels of functioning across several standardized QOL scales; mild impairment was found on the CARES-SF Sexual Scale. The presence of breast-related symptoms at survey, use of adjuvant therapy, having lower income, and type of breast surgery were significantly associated with lower QOL 5 to 10 years post-diagnosis on one or more of the scales. CONCLUSIONS: Our results emphasize that younger long-term survivors of breast cancer have a high QOL across several standardized measures.

METHODS: A total of 60, 572 non-Hispanic white and black participants in the ongoing Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial underwent trial-sponsored screening flexible sigmoidoscopy (FSG) without biopsy at baseline in 10 geographically dispersed centers from November 1993 to July 2001. Subjects with polyps or mass lesions detected by FSG were referred to their physicians for diagnostic workup, the cost of which was not covered by PLCO. The records of follow-up evaluations were collected and reviewed. We used log binomial modeling with adjustment for age, education, sex, body mass index, smoking, family history of colorectal cancer, colon examination within previous 3 years, personal history of polyps, and screening center to examine whether utilization of diagnostic colonoscopy and yield of neoplasia differed by race. RESULTS: Among 57 561 whites and 3011 blacks who underwent FSG, 13,743 (23.9%) and 767 (25.5%) had abnormal examinations, respectively. A total of 9944 (72.4%) whites and 480 (62.6%) blacks had diagnostic colonoscopy within 1 year following the abnormal FSG screening. When compared with whites, blacks were less likely to undergo diagnostic evaluation (adjusted risk ratio = 0.88, 95% confidence interval = 0.83 to 0.93). Overall, among subjects with diagnostic colonoscopy (n = 10 424), there was no statistically significant difference by race in the prevalence of adenoma, advanced adenoma, advanced pathology in small adenomas (high-grade dysplasia or villous histology in adenomas <10 mm), or colorectal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a lower follow-up for screen-detected abnormalities among blacks when compared with whites but little difference in the yield of colorectal neoplasia.

METHODS: Data were collected from a population-based cohort of non-Hispanic White (n = 448), Black (n = 197), and Hispanic (n = 84) breast cancer survivors (stage 0-IIIa) in the Health, Eating, Activity, and Lifestyle Study. Physical activity was assessed approximately 2.5 years after breast cancer diagnosis, with QOL assessed on average 6 to 12 months later. We used structural equation modeling to examine relationships between meeting recommended levels of physical activity and QOL, stratifying by race/ethnicity and adjusting for other demographic, comorbidity, and treatment effects. RESULTS: Structural equation modeling indicated that meeting recommended levels of physical activity had significant positive associations with QOL for Black and non-Hispanic White women (P < 0.05). Fewer Black women reported meeting recommended physical activity levels (P < 0.001), but meeting recommendations was associated with better QOL.

METHODS: In the Breast Cancer Care in Chicago study, self-reports at interview were used to define patients as having a screen-detected breast cancer or having symptomatic awareness despite a recent screening mammogram (SADRS), in the past 1 or 2 years. Patients with symptomatic breast cancer who did not report a recent prior screen were excluded from these analyses. Characteristics associated with more aggressive disease [estrogen receptor (ER)- and progesterone receptor (PR)-negative status and higher tumor grade] were abstracted from medical records. Mammogram facility characteristics that might indicate aspects of screening quality were defined and controlled for in some analyses. RESULTS: SADRS was more common among non-Hispanic black and Hispanic than among non-Hispanic white patients (36% and 42% vs. 25%, respectively, P = 0.0004). SADRS was associated with ER/PR-negative and higher-grade disease. Patients screened at sites that relied on dedicated radiologists and sites that were breast imaging centers of excellence were less likely to report SADRS. Tumor and facility factors together accounted for two thirds of the disparity in SADRS (proportion mediated = 70%, P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Facility resources and tumor aggressiveness explain much of the racial/ethnic disparity in symptomatic breast cancer among recently screened patients.

Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained from unadjusted and adjusted models to assess the independent associations between race and test use. RESULTS: Adherence to the Medicare-covered intervals for CRC tests was low (56.8% for whites, 39.1% for African Americans), and did not significantly differ by race after adjustment. African Americans were, however, significantly less likely to have ever been tested (OR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.33-0.70) and more likely to have had an endoscopic test than an FOBT (OR = 3.06, 95% CI = 1.70-5.51). CONCLUSIONS: The type of test used to screen for colorectal cancer has important implications for compliance with recommended screening intervals. Understanding reasons for racial differences in CRC test use may help identify approaches to increasing test use in the Medicare population.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,"Statistical Research and Applications, Health Services and Economics Branch, Surveillance Research Program, Applied Research Program",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=16530619,0,1,0,1

To inform our understanding of racial disparities in prostate cancer treatment and outcomes, this study compared diffusion of IMRT in African American (AA) and Caucasian American (CA) prostate cancer patients during the early years of IMRT diffusion using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database. A retrospective cohort of 947 AA and 10,028 CA patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer from 2002 through 2006, who were treated with either IMRT or non-IMRT as primary treatment within 1 year of diagnoses was constructed. Logistic regression was used to examine potential differences in diffusion of IMRT in AA and CA patients, while adjusting for socioeconomic and clinical covariates. A significantly smaller proportion of AA compared with CA patients received IMRT for localized prostate cancer (45% vs. 53%, p < .0001). Racial differences were apparent in multivariable analysis though did not achieve statistical significance, as time and factors associated with race (socioeconomic, geographic, and tumor related factors) explained the preponderance of variance in use of IMRT.

Disparities within each subtype of breast cancer have not been well documented. METHODS: Using data from 18 SEER cancer registries, we identified 102,064 women aged 20 years or older, diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in 2010-2011, and with known stage, hormone receptor (HR), and HER2 status. Associations between race/ethnicity and cancer stage and receipt of guideline-concordant treatment were evaluated according to HR/HER2 status. RESULTS: Overall, African American and Hispanic women were 30% to 60% more likely to be diagnosed with stage II-IV breast cancer compared with non-Hispanic whites. African American women had 40% to 70% higher risks of stage IV breast cancer across all four subtypes. American Indian/Alaska Native women had a 3.9-fold higher risk of stage IV triple-negative breast cancer. African American and Hispanic whites were 30% to 40% more likely to receive non-guideline-concordant treatment for breast cancer overall and across subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: Women in several racial/ethnic groups are more likely to be diagnosed with more advanced stage breast cancer. African American and American Indian/Alaska Native women in particular had the highest risk of being diagnosed with stage IV triple-negative breast cancer. African American and Hispanic women were also consistently at higher risk of not receiving guideline-concordant treatment across subtypes.

METHODS: We used a database linking the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry with Medicare claims to extract treatment information for 90,128 men aged 65 years and older, who were newly diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer. RESULTS: The use of aggressive therapy has increased among white men over time; but aggressive therapy has recently declined among African-American men. Accounting for age, grade, socioeconomic status, and comorbidity, African-American men were 26% less likely to receive aggressive therapy than white men (odds ratio 0.74; 95% confidence interval 0.70 to 0.79). The use of ADT has increased substantially in both the primary and the adjuvant settings. By 1999, 45.6% of white men and 35.8% of African-American men who selected conservative management received primary ADT; among men treated with external beam radiotherapy, the proportion receiving adjuvant ADT was 53.7% for white men and 42.4% for African-American men (P <0.001).

Various lifestyle factors have been examined in relation to prostate cancer risk, including diet, obesity, and physical activity; however, none of them has been consistently related to risk. In the Multiethnic Cohort Study, we investigated whether lifestyle-related factors are associated with prostate cancer risk and whether such factors explain the racial/ethnic differences in risk. METHODS: During a mean follow-up of 13.9 years, 7,115 incident cases were identified among 75,216 white, African-American, Native Hawaiian, Japanese American, and Latino men. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate relative risks (RRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) for prostate cancer. RESULTS: Among selected lifestyle-related factors including body mass index, height, education, physical activity, and intakes of alcohol, calcium, legumes, lycopene, and selenium, only smoking (RR for current (>/=20 cigarettes/day) vs. never smoking = 0.72; 95 % CI 0.63-0.83) and history of diabetes (RR for yes vs. no = 0.78; 95 % CI 0.72-0.85) were significantly associated with prostate cancer risk. Compared to whites, the risk of incident prostate cancer was twofold higher in African-Americans and 16 % higher in Latinos.

Previous research has largely focused on patient-level factors, and less is known about the role that health care facilities may play in delayed breast cancer care. OBJECTIVES: We examined racial/ethnic disparities in delayed diagnosis for breast cancer in the Breast Cancer Care in Chicago Study and estimated the potential mediating effects of facility factors. RESEARCH DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: Breast cancer patients (N=606) contributed interview and medical record data as part of a population-based study. MEASURES: Race/ethnicity was self-reported at interview. Diagnostic delay was defined as an excess of 60 days between medical presentation and a definitive diagnosis. Facility factors included the facility of medical presentation with respect to: (1) accreditation through the National Consortium of Breast Centers; (2) certification as a Breast Imaging Center of Excellence through the American College of Radiology; and (3) status as a disproportionate share hospital through the state of Illinois as well as the number of facilities used between presentation and diagnosis. RESULTS: Relative to non-Hispanic whites, minorities were more likely to experience a diagnostic delay, present at a nonaccredited facility and at a disproportionate share hospital, and involve multiple facilities in their diagnosis. Together, facility factors accounted for 43% of the disparity in diagnostic delay (P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Initial presentation of breast cancer at higher resourced facilities can reduce diagnostic delays.

This emphasizes the importance of receiving appropriate palliative care. Racial/ethnic cancer treatment disparities have been observed for many cancer sites. We examine patterns of care in a population-based sample of African American, Hispanic and non-Hispanic white patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Eligible cases were age 20 or older and newly diagnosed in 1998 with primary adenocarcinoma of the pancreas reported to the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program and selected for the NCI Patterns of Care/Quality of Care (POC/QOC) project (n = 697). RESULTS: Chemotherapy, the most frequently received treatment was less frequently received by African American patients (odds ratio [OR] 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-0.95) and radiation less frequently received by Hispanic compared to non-Hispanic white white patients (OR 0.50, 95% CI, 0.27-0.95) after adjustment for age, stage, size of tumor, and insurance status in a multivariate regression model. Cancer-directed surgery of the primary site was received by 14.1% of patients, which did not significantly differ by race/ethnicity.

CONCLUSION: Differences in primary tumor size, stage and insurance status contributed to racial/ethnic differences in the receipt of cancer-directed surgery but did not explain differences in the receipt of chemotherapy for African American or radiation for Hispanic patients.

The intervention targets indoor tanning users' perceptions of the benefits and value of tanning and addresses the role of body image-related constructs in indoor tanning. METHOD: Participants were 186 young adult women who reported indoor tanning at least once in the past 12 months. The study design was a 2-arm randomized controlled trial with pre- and postintervention assessments and random assignment to an intervention or control condition. Intervention acceptability was assessed by obtaining participants' evaluation of the intervention. Regression analyses were used to test for intervention condition differences in preliminary behavioral outcomes measured at 6 weeks postintervention. RESULTS: Participants provided favorable evaluations of the intervention on several dimensions and a highly positive overall rating. Intervention participants were more likely to report abstaining from indoor tanning and indicated a lower likelihood of using indoor tanning in the future compared with control participants on the postintervention assessment. No differences were found for sunburns. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this pilot randomized controlled trial provide evidence that the indoor tanning intervention is acceptable to participants and may encourage cessation of indoor tanning behavior.

METHODS: The Kentucky Cancer Registry has developed a cancer burden Rank Sum Index (RSI) to guide statewide comprehensive cancer control activities. However, lack of interval estimates for RSI limits its applications. RSI also weights individual measures with little inherent variability equally as ones with large variability. To address these issues, a Modified Sum Index (MSI) was developed to take into account of magnitudes of observed values. A simulation approach was used to generate individual and simultaneous 95% CIs for the rank MSI. An uncertainty measure was also calculated. RESULTS: At the Area Development Districts (ADDs) level, the ranks of the RSI and the MSI were almost identical, while larger variation was found at the county level. The widths of the CIs at the ADD level were considerably shorter than those at the county level. CONCLUSION: The measures developed for estimating composite cancer burden indices and the simulated CIs provide valuable information to guide cancer prevention and control effort. Caution should be taken when interpreting ranks from small population geographic units where the CIs for the ranks overlap considerably.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Surveillance Research Program,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=29372360,0,1,0,0

METHODS: We examined the association between self-reported symptoms (lump, nipple discharge, pain, other) and breast cancer risk for screening and diagnostic mammograms in 57,681 women. Subanalyses evaluated risk among women with no prior mammograms, new symptoms, and repeated symptoms. One thousand, three hundred and eighty-nine women were diagnosed with cancer within 12 months of their mammograms. We calculated the breast cancer rate for each symptom and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for breast cancer among symptomatic women compared with asymptomatic women. RESULTS: Women reporting a lump had an increased odds of breast cancer compared with asymptomatic women (OR for diagnostic examination = 2.8, 95% CI = 2.3 to 3.4; OR for screening examination = 3.6, 95% CI = 2.6 to 5.0).

Addict Behav 2015;51:93-99",2015,Rate of nicotine metabolism and smoking cessation outcomes in a community-based sample of treatment-seeking smokers,"BACKGROUND: In samples from controlled randomized clinical trials, a smoker's rate of nicotine metabolism, measured by the 3-hydroxycotinine to cotinine ratio (NMR), predicts response to transdermal nicotine. Replication of this relationship in community-based samples of treatment-seeking smokers may help guide the implementation of the NMR for personalized treatment for nicotine dependence. METHODS: Data from a community-based sample of treatment seeking smokers (N=499) who received 8weeks of transdermal nicotine and 4 behavioral counseling sessions were used to evaluate associations between the NMR and smoking cessation. Secondary outcomes included withdrawal and craving, depression and anxiety, side effects, and treatment adherence. RESULTS: The NMR was a significant predictor of abstinence (OR=.56, 95% CI: 0.33-0.95, p=.03), with faster metabolizers showing lower quit rates than slower metabolizers (24% vs. 33%). Faster nicotine metabolizers exhibited significantly higher levels of anxiety symptoms over time during treatment, vs. slower metabolizers (NMR x Time interaction: F[3,357]=3.29, p=.02). NMR was not associated with changes in withdrawal, craving, depression, side effects, and treatment adherence (p's>.05). CONCLUSIONS: In a community-based sample of treatment-seeking smokers, faster nicotine metabolizers were significantly less likely to quit smoking and showed higher rates of anxiety symptoms during a smoking cessation treatment program, vs. slower nicotine metabolizers.

Zero-inflated Poisson regression was used to assess effects of reporting day on frequency of consumption for the checklists and number of items reported for the FR. Interactions between day and BMI were tested using contrast statements. Frequency of reported consumption declined across days among males and females for total items and many of the eight food groups on the 7-day checklist; among females, the effect of reporting day differed by BMI category for the meat, fish, and poultry group. Smaller declines across days were observed for some of the 22 food groups on the 30-day checklist; no interactions with BMI were apparent. No reporting day effects were observed in the FR data.

METHODS: We identified 184 Black women as having an abnormal mammogram or clinical breast exam requiring immediate follow-up and they were interviewed and their medical records examined. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to assess the association between patient and health care system factors and diagnostic resolution within 3 months of the abnormal finding. RESULTS: Within 3 months, 39% of women were without diagnostic resolution and 28% within 6 months. Neither socioeconomic status nor system barriers were associated with timely diagnostic resolution. Timely resolution was associated with mammogram severity, patients asking questions (OR, 2.73; 95% CI, 1.25-5.96), or receiving next step information (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.08-6.21) at the initial mammogram. Women with prior breast abnormalities were less likely to complete timely diagnostic resolution (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.20-0.85), as were women with higher levels of cancer anxiety (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.27-0.92).

J Natl Cancer Inst 2004;96(20):1518-1527",2004,"Reason for late-stage breast cancer: absence of screening or detection, or breakdown in follow-up?","BACKGROUND: Mammography screening increases the detection of early-stage breast cancers. Therefore, implementing screening should reduce the percentage of women who are diagnosed with late-stage disease. However, despite high national mammography screening rates, late-stage breast cancers still occur, possibly because of failures in screening implementation. METHODS: Using data from seven health care plans that included 1.5 million women aged 50 years or older, we conducted retrospective reviews of chart and automated data for 3 years before 1995-1999 diagnoses of late-stage (metastatic and/or tumor size > or =3 cm; case subjects, n = 1347) and early-stage breast cancers (control subjects, n = 1347). We categorized the earliest screening mammogram during the period 13-36 months before diagnosis as none (absence of screening), negative (absence of detection), or positive (potential breakdown in follow-up). We compared the proportion of case and control subjects in each category of screening implementation and estimated the likelihood (odds ratio [OR] with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) of late-stage breast cancer. We also evaluated demographic characteristics associated with absence of screening in women with late-stage disease. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Absence of screening, absence of detection, and potential breakdown in follow-up were distributed differently among case (52.1%, 39.5%, and 8.4%, respectively) and control subjects (34.4%, 56.9%, and 8.8%, respectively) (P = .03). Among all women, the odds of having late-stage cancer were higher among women with an absence of screening (OR = 2.17, 95% CI = 1.84 to 2.56; P<.001). Among case patients, women were more likely to be in the absence-of-screening group if they were aged 75 years or older (OR = 2.77, 95% CI = 2.10 to 3.65), unmarried (OR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.41 to 2.24), or without a family history of breast cancer (OR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.45 to 2.34). A higher proportion of women from census blocks with less education (58.5% versus 49.4%; P = .003) or lower median annual income (54.4% versus 42.9%; P = .004) were in the absence-of-screening category compared with the proportion for the other two categories combined.

Little is known about adherence to that interval. METHODS: We describe patterns of and factors associated with subsequent colonoscopy among persons with >/=3 adenomas and/or >/=1 adenoma with villous/tubulovillous histology in four U.S. integrated healthcare delivery systems. We report Kaplan-Meier estimators of the cumulative percentage of patients undergoing colonoscopy 6 months to 3.5 years after an index colonoscopy with high-risk findings. Combining data from three healthcare systems, we used multivariable logistic regression with inverse probability of censoring weights to estimate ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations between patient characteristics and receipt of subsequent colonoscopy. RESULTS: Among 6,909 persons with advanced adenomas, the percent receiving a subsequent colonoscopy 6 months to 3.5 years later ranged from 18.3% (95% CI: 11.7%-27.8%) to 59.5% (95% CI: 53.8%-65.2%) across healthcare systems. Differences remained significant in the multivariable model. Patients with >/=3 adenomas were more likely than those with 1 to 2 villous/tubulovillous adenomas to undergo subsequent colonoscopy. Subsequent colonoscopy was also more common for patients ages 60-74 and less common for patients ages 80 to 89 compared with those ages 50 to 54 years at their index colonoscopy. Sex, race/ethnicity, and comorbidity index score were generally not associated with subsequent colonoscopy receipt.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined survivors of adult cancers from the 2010 National Health Interview Survey (N = 1,777). Multivariable logistic regression models examined factors associated with receipt of and satisfaction with psychosocial care. RESULTS: Most survivors (55.1%) reported neither provider discussions nor use of PCSG; 31.4% reported provider discussion only, 4.4% reported use of PCSG only, and 8.9% reported both. Non-Hispanic blacks (v non-Hispanic whites), married survivors, survivors of breast cancer (v prostate or less prevalent cancers), those treated with chemotherapy, and survivors reporting past research study/clinical trial participation were more likely to report provider discussion(s) (P < .01).

Although advances in screening and diagnostic techniques have led to earlier detection of prostate cancer, a portion of patients still present with late-stage disease. METHODS: Population-based cancer registry data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (cases from 1988 to 2003, follow-up through 2005) were used to calculate annual age-adjusted incidence rates of stage IV prostate cancer (overall and for the subset presenting with distant metastases) and to assess time trends in patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics and survival. RESULTS: From 1988 to 2003, the age-adjusted incidence of stage IV prostate cancer significantly declined by 6.4% each year. The proportion of men diagnosed at younger ages, with poorly differentiated tumors, or who underwent a radical prostatectomy significantly increased over time. Five-year relative survival improved across the study period (from 41.6% to 62.3%), particularly in those diagnosed at younger ages or with moderately to well-differentiated tumors. Later years of diagnosis were independently associated with a decreased risk of death (from all causes and from prostate cancer specifically) after controlling for important patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics. Tumor grade and receipt of radical prostatectomy appeared to be the strongest independent prognostic indicators. Temporal trends were similar in the subset presenting with distant metastases, except that no significant improvement in survival was observed. CONCLUSIONS: As younger men may expect to live longer with advanced prostate cancer, there remains a need to widen the range of therapeutic and supportive care options.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Prostate,Surveillance Research Program,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19969335,0,1,0,0

As part of Strategies and Opportunities to STOP Colon Cancer in Priority Populations (STOP CRC), we recruited eight separate community health centers (consisting of 26 individual safety net clinics) into a large comparative effectiveness pragmatic study to evaluate methods of raising the rates of colorectal cancer screening. METHODS: In partnership with STOP CRC's advisory board, we defined criteria to identify eligible health centers and applied these criteria to a list of health centers in Washington, Oregon, and California affiliated with Oregon Community Health Information Network, a 16-state practice-based research network of federally sponsored health centers. Project staff contacted centers that met eligibility criteria and arranged in-person meetings of key study investigators with health center leadership teams. We used the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research to thematically analyze the content of discussions during these meetings to identify major facilitators of and barriers to health center participation. RESULTS: From an initial list of 41 health centers, 11 met the initial inclusion criteria. Of these, leaders at three centers declined and at eight centers (26 clinic sites) agreed to participate (73%). Participating and nonparticipating health centers were similar with respect to clinic size, percent Hispanic patients, and percent uninsured patients. Participating health centers had higher proportions of Medicaid patients and higher baseline colorectal cancer screening rates. Common facilitators of participation were perception by center leadership that the project was an opportunity to increase colorectal cancer screening rates and to use electronic health record tools for population management. Barriers to participation were concerns of center leaders about ability to provide fecal testing to and assure follow-up of uninsured patients, limited clinic capacity to prepare mailings required by the study protocol, discomfort with randomization, and concerns about delaying program implementation at some clinics due to the research requirements. CONCLUSION: Our findings address an important research gap and may inform future efforts to recruit community health centers into pragmatic research.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Colorectal,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26419905,0,1,0,1

Standard care advice and self-help materials to help parents reduce child tobacco smoke exposure is not sufficient to promote change in underserved populations. We tested the efficacy of a behavioral counseling approach with underserved maternal smokers to reduce infant's and preschooler's tobacco smoke exposure. DESIGN: A two-arm randomized trial: enhanced behavior counseling (experimental) versus enhanced standard care (control). Assessment staff members were blinded. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred randomized maternal smokers were recruited from low-income urban communities. Participants had a child aged <4 years exposed to two or more maternal cigarettes/day at baseline. INTERVENTION: Philadelphia Family Rules for Establishing Smoke-free Homes (FRESH) included 16 weeks of counseling. Using a behavioral shaping approach within an individualized cognitive-behavioral therapy framework, counseling reinforced efforts to adopt increasingly challenging tobacco smoke exposure-protective behaviors with the eventual goal of establishing a smoke-free home. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were end-of-treatment child cotinine and reported tobacco smoke exposure (maternal cigarettes/day exposed). Secondary outcomes were end-of-treatment 7-day point-prevalence self-reported cigarettes smoked/day and bioverified quit status. RESULTS: Participation in FRESH behavioral counseling was associated with lower child cotinine (beta=-0.18, p=0.03) and reported tobacco smoke exposure (beta=-0.57, p=0.03) at the end of treatment. Mothers in behavioral counseling smoked fewer cigarettes/day (beta=-1.84, p=0.03) and had higher bioverified quit rates compared with controls (13.8% vs 1.9%, chi(2)=10.56, p<0.01). There was no moderating effect of other smokers living at home.

DATA SOURCES: Elderly (65+) women with early-stage, incident breast cancer surgery in 2003. STUDY DESIGN: A population-based, prospective survey study. METHODS: Two-stage, instrumental variable regression models. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Women treated in high-volume hospitals were significantly less likely to die of any cause by 5 years after surgery, even after adjustments for self-selection and a number of other factors. The relationship was larger and more significant for breast cancer-specific mortality. Although the general pattern of better mortality outcomes held for moderately sized hospitals, the relationships were not statistically significant. In contrast, there was no relationship of surgeon volume with all-cause or breast cancer-specific mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital volume, but not surgeon volume, is associated with better survival among women with breast cancer. The magnitude of the potential improvement was substantial and comparable with the benefit conferred by many systemic therapies.

We have shown that chronic stress promoted NSCLC xenografts in mice via stress neurotransmitter-activated cAMP signaling downstream of beta-adrenergic receptors and incidental beta-blocker therapy was reported to improve clinical outcomes in NSCLC patients. These findings suggest that psychological stress promotes NSCLC whereas pharmacologically or psychologically induced decreases in cAMP may inhibit NSCLC. Cancer stem cells are thought to drive the development, progression and resistance to therapy of NSCLC. However, their potential regulation by stress neurotransmitters has not been investigated. In the current study, epinephrine increased the number of cancer stem cell like cells (CSCs) from three NSCLC cell lines in spheroid formation assays while enhancing intracellular cAMP and the stem cell markers sonic hedgehog (SHH), aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 (ALDH-1) and Gli1, effects reversed by GABA or dynorphin B via Galphai -mediated inhibition of cAMP formation. The growth of NSCLC xenografts in a mouse model of stress reduction was significantly reduced as compared with mice maintained under standard conditions. Stress reduction reduced serum levels of corticosterone, norepinephrine and epinephrine while the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and opioid peptides increased. Stress reduction significantly reduced cAMP, VEGF, p-ERK, p-AKT, p-CREB, p-SRc, SHH, ALDH-1 and Gli1 in xenograft tissues whereas cleaved caspase-3 and p53 were induced. We conclude that stress neurotransmitters activate CSCs in NSCLC via multiple cAMP-mediated pathways and that pharmacologically or psychologically induced decreases in cAMP signaling may improve clinical outcomes in NSCLC patients.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Lung,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26088878,0,1,0,0

However, among women diagnosed with breast cancer, it is unclear whether higher density portends reduced survival, independent of other factors. METHODS: We evaluated relationships between mammographic density and risk of death from breast cancer and all causes within the US Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. We studied 9232 women diagnosed with primary invasive breast carcinoma during 1996-2005, with a mean follow-up of 6.6 years. Mammographic density was assessed using the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) density classification. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by Cox proportional hazards regression; women with scattered fibroglandular densities (BI-RADS 2) were the referent group. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: A total of 1795 women died, of whom 889 died of breast cancer. In multivariable analyses (adjusted for site, age at and year of diagnosis, American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, body mass index, mode of detection, treatment, and income), high density (BI-RADS 4) was not related to risk of death from breast cancer (HR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.71 to 1.19) or death from all causes (HR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.68 to 1.02).

METHODS: We collected a blood sample and information on physical activity among women diagnosed 2 to 3 years earlier using an interview-administered questionnaire. Trained staff measured weight. C-peptide, leptin, and IGFs were assayed by RIA. Mean hormone levels within body mass index and physical activity categories were adjusted for confounders using analysis of covariance methods. RESULTS: We observed higher C-peptide (P for trend = 0.0001) and leptin (P for trend = 0.0001) levels and lower IGF-I levels (P for trend = 0.0001) with higher levels of body mass index. We observed lower C-peptide (P for trend = 0.001) and leptin (P for trend = 0.001) levels and higher IGF-I (P for trend = 0.0037) and IGF-binding protein-3 (P for trend = 0.055) levels with higher levels of physical activity.

Health Psychol 2015;34(10):1038-1042",2015,"Relationships among spousal communication, self-efficacy, and motivation among expectant Latino fathers who smoke","OBJECTIVE: Cigarette smoking is a prevalent problem among Latinos, yet little is known about what factors motivate them to quit smoking or make them feel more confident that they can. Given cultural emphases on familial bonds among Latinos (e.g., familismo), it is possible that communication processes among Latino spouses play an important role. The present study tested a mechanistic model in which perceived spousal constructive communication patterns predicted changes in level of motivation for smoking cessation through changes in self-efficacy among Latino expectant fathers. METHODS: Latino males (n = 173) and their pregnant partners participated in a couple-based intervention targeting males' smoking. Couples completed self-report measures of constructive communication, self-efficacy (male partners only), and motivation to quit (male partners only) at 4 time points throughout the intervention. RESULTS: Higher levels of perceived constructive communication among Latino male partners predicted subsequent increases in male partners' self-efficacy and, to a lesser degree, motivation to quit smoking; however, self-efficacy did not mediate associations between constructive communication and motivation to quit smoking. Furthermore, positive relationships with communication were only significant at measurements taken after completion of the intervention. Female partners' level of perceived constructive communication did not predict male partners' outcomes. CONCLUSION: These results provide preliminary evidence to support the utility of couple-based interventions for Latino men who smoke. Findings also suggest that perceptions of communication processes among Latino partners (particularly male partners) may be an important target for interventions aimed at increasing desire and perceived ability to quit smoking among Latino men.

The PYTPAQ was completed twice at baseline, 9 weeks apart (on average), by 154 healthy Canadian men and women aged 35-65 years for assessment of reliability. The PYTPAQ was completed again 1 year later as a self-administered questionnaire. Four times during the year, participants wore an accelerometer for 7 days and completed 7-day physical activity logs. The authors assessed validity by comparing PYTPAQ summary values with 1-year averages of the physical activity logs and accelerometer data and with physical fitness and anthropometric data measured at baseline and 1 year. Spearman correlations for reliability (metabolic equivalent-hours/week) were 0.64 for total activity, 0.70 for occupational activity, 0.73 for recreational activity, and 0.65 for household activity. For total activity, the intraclass correlation coefficient for correlation between the PYTPAQ and the 7-day physical activity logs was 0.42 (95% confidence interval: 0.28, 0.54), and for the accelerometer data it was 0.18 (95% confidence interval: 0.03, 0.32). Spearman correlations between PYTPAQ hours/week of vigorous activity and maximal oxygen uptake were 0.37 and 0.32 at baseline and follow-up, respectively.

The zinc finger protein 804A (ZNF804A) gene is a biologically plausible susceptibility gene for heroin addiction, given its function as a transcription factor in human brain. Novel associations of two common ZNF804A single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs7597593 and rs1344706, with heroin addiction have been reported in Han Chinese. Both SNPs have also been implicated for regulating ZNF804A expression in human brain, including the addiction-relevant dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In this independent replication study, we tested the rs7597593 and rs1344706 SNP genotypes and their corresponding haplotypes for association with heroin addiction using cases drawn from the Urban Health Study and population controls: total N = 10 757 [7095 European Americans (EAs) and 3662 African Americans (AAs)].

METHODS: Subjects were women age 20-79 years who had a screening mammogram between 1 June 1996 and 1 August 1997, in Seattle, Washington. Women with increased breast density (upper two categories of BI-RADS terminology) (n = 14,432) were compared to those with fatty breasts (lower two categories (n = 14,552). Unconditional logistic regression was used with adjustment for age at mammogram, parity, age at first birth, menopausal status, current use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), and body mass index. RESULTS: The association of nulliparity with density was evident for women at all ages (odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.5 (1.3-1.7) and 1.6 (1.4-1.9) for women age < or = 45 and > 65, respectively).

Using a large cross-sectional sample of survivors of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), this study explored associations between patient-reported resilience, psychological distress, posttraumatic growth, and health-related quality of life. METHODS: Between July 1, 2013 and June 30, 2014, the annual Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) posttransplant survivorship survey queried patient-reported health and functional status and included instruments assessing psychosocial outcomes: the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory, the Cancer and Treatment Distress measure, and the 12-item Medical Outcomes Study Short Form quality-of-life scale. Multivariate linear and logistic regression models included demographic and health covariates extracted from the FHCRC research database. RESULTS: Among 4643 adult survivors of HCT, 1823 (39%) responded after a single mailing and subsequent reminder letter. The participants' median age was 59 years (interquartile range [IQR], 50-66 years); 52.5% were male, and most were non-Hispanic white. The median time since HCT was 9 years (IQR, 3-18 years). Lower patient-reported resilience was associated with chronic graft-versus-host disease of higher severity, lower performance scores, missing work because of health, and permanent disability (all P < .0001). After adjustments for demographic and health characteristics, patients reporting low resilience scores had higher odds of having psychological distress (odds ratio [OR], 3.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1-4.3) and being in the lowest quartile for mental health-related quality of life (OR, 5.9; 95% CI, 4.4-8.0).

First, they argue that although clarifying values is central to decision making under uncertainty, it is not clear that decision aids--as they have been conceived and operationalized so far--can and should be used to achieve this goal. The pursuit of clarifying values, particularly values clarification exercises, raises a number of ethical, methodological, and conceptual issues, and the authors suggest research questions that should be addressed before values clarification is routinely endorsed.

Risk stratification advanced colorectal neoplasia (ACN) provides a rational strategy for reconciling these differences. OBJECTIVE: To assess the importance of risk stratification in PCP decision making related to test preference for average-risk patients and receptivity to use of an electronic risk assessment tool for ACN to facilitate SDM. DESIGN: Mixed methods, including qualitative key informant interviews and a cross-sectional survey. PARTICIPANTS: PCPs at an urban, academic safety-net institution. MAIN MEASURES: Screening preferences, factors influencing patient recommendations and receptivity to use of a risk stratification tool. KEY RESULTS: Nine PCPs participated in interviews and 57 completed the survey. Despite an overwhelming preference for colonoscopy by 95% of respondents, patient risk (67%) and patient preferences (63%) were more influential in their decision making than patient comorbidities (31%; P < 0.001).

While previous studies have suggested that ADT negatively influences glycemic control in existing diabetes, its association with diabetes complications has not been investigated. In this study, we examined the association between ADT use and diabetes complications in prostate cancer patients. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted among men with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer between 1995 and 2008, enrolled in three integrated health care systems. Men had radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy (curative intent therapy), existing type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and were followed through December 2010 (n = 5,336). Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine associations between ADT use and diabetes complications (any complication), and individual complications (diabetic neuropathy, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic amputation or diabetic cataract) after prostate cancer diagnosis. RESULTS: ADT use was associated with an increased risk of any diabetes complication after prostate cancer diagnosis (adjusted hazard ratio, AHR, 1.12, 95% CI 1.03-1.23) as well as an increased risk of each individual complication compared to non-use. CONCLUSION: ADT use in men with T2DM, who received curative intent therapy for prostate cancer, was associated with an increased risk of diabetes complications. These findings support those of previous studies, which showed that ADT worsened diabetes control. Additional, larger studies are required to confirm these findings and to potentially inform the development of a risk-benefit assessment for men with existing T2DM, before initiating ADT.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Prostate,"Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program, Healthcare Delivery Research Program",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=29959604,0,1,0,0

R Bioconductor, edgeR, was adopted to conduct differential gene expression analysis between paired normal and tumor tissues. A generalized linear model was applied to identify genes that were differentially expressed in nonsmoker and smoker patients as well as genes that varied between these two groups. We identified 2273 genes that showed differential expression with FDR < 0.05 and |logFC| >1 in nonsmoker tumor versus normal tissues; 3030 genes in the smoking group; and 1967 genes were common to both groups. Sixty-eight and 70% of the identified genes were downregulated in nonsmoking and smoking groups, respectively.

We also identified 175 genes that were significantly differently expressed between tumor samples from nonsmoker and smoker patients. Gene expression profile varied substantially between smoker and nonsmoker patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Smoking patients overall showed far more complicated disease mechanism and have more dysregulation in their gene expression profiles.

Role of religiosity and spirituality in complementary and alternative medicine use among cancer survivors in California. Integr Cancer Ther 2008;7(3):139-146",2008,Role of religiosity and spirituality in complementary and alternative medicine use among cancer survivors in California,"OBJECTIVES: Cancer survivors often turn to religion, spirituality, and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) because they perceive these areas as being more holistic and patient-centered than conventional medicine. Because increased religiosity and spirituality have been found to be associated with higher CAM use in the general population, it was hypothesized that these factors would be important predictors of CAM use in cancer survivors. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: The study included a subsample of 1844 people with cancer or a history of cancer from the 2003 California Health Interview Survey of CAM, a cross-sectional survey of a population-based sample of adults in California. Prevalence and predictors of religious/spiritual forms of CAM (R/S CAM) and nonreligious/nonspiritual forms of CAM (non-R/S CAM) were compared. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the predictors of R/S CAM and non-R/S CAM. RESULTS: Nearly two thirds of participants reported using at least 1 type of R/S CAM, and 85% reported ever using non-R/S CAM. The majority of cancer survivors reported that they were very/moderately religious or spiritual. Both religiosity and spirituality were strongly related to non-R/S CAM use, but in opposite directions. Very or moderately religious cancer survivors were less likely (odds ratio=0.30; 95% confidence interval, 0.12-0.40) than nonreligious cancer survivors to use non-R/S CAM. In contrast, very or moderately spiritual cancer survivors were more likely (odds ratio=2.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-6.02) than nonspiritual cancer survivors to use non-R/S CAM. CONCLUSIONS: The use of R/S CAM and non-R/S CAM is very high in cancer survivors.

Tob Control 2014;23(6):484-490",2014,Russia SimSmoke: the long-term effects of tobacco control policies on smoking prevalence and smoking-attributable deaths in Russia,"BACKGROUND: Russia has high smoking rates and weak tobacco control policies. A simulation model is used to examine the effect of tobacco control policies on past and future smoking prevalence and premature mortality in Russia. METHODS: The Russia model was developed using the SimSmoke tobacco control model previously developed for the USA and other nations. The model inputs population size, birth, death and smoking rates specific to Russia. It assesses, individually and in combination, the effect of seven types of policies consistent with the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC): taxes, smoke-free air, mass media campaign, advertising bans, warning labels, cessation treatment and youth access policies. Outcomes are smoking prevalence and the number of smoking-attributable deaths by age and gender from 2009 to 2055. RESULTS: Increasing cigarette taxes to 70% of retail price, stronger smoke-free air laws, a high-intensity media campaign and comprehensive treatment policies are each potent policies to reduce smoking prevalence and smoking-attributable premature deaths in Russia. With the stronger set of policies, the model estimates that, relative to the status quo trend, smoking prevalence can be reduced by as much as 30% by 2020, with a 50% reduction projected by 2055. This translates into 2 684 994 male and 1 011 985 female premature deaths averted from 2015-2055. CONCLUSIONS: SimSmoke results highlight the relative contribution of policies to reducing the tobacco health burden in Russia. Significant inroads to reducing smoking prevalence and premature mortality can be achieved through strengthening tobacco control policies in line with FCTC recommendations.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=23853252,0,1,0,0

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between screening colonoscopy and risk for incident late-stage colorectal cancer (CRC). DESIGN: Nested case-control study. SETTING: Four U.S. health plans. PATIENTS: 1039 average-risk adults enrolled for at least 5 years in one of the health plans. Case patients were aged 55 to 85 years on their diagnosis date (reference date) of stage IIB or higher (late-stage) CRC during 2006 to 2008. One or 2 control patients were selected for each case patient, matched on birth year, sex, health plan, and prior enrollment duration. MEASUREMENTS: Receipt of CRC screening 3 months to 10 years before the reference date, ascertained through medical record audits. Case patients and control patients were compared on receipt of screening colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy by using conditional logistic regression that accounted for health history, socioeconomic status, and other screening exposures. RESULTS: In analyses restricted to 471 eligible case patients and their 509 matched control patients, 13 case patients (2.8%) and 46 control patients (9.0%) had undergone screening colonoscopy, which corresponded to an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of 0.29 (95% CI, 0.15 to 0.58) for any late-stage CRC, 0.36 (CI, 0.16 to 0.80) for right colon cancer, and 0.26 (CI, 0.06 to 1.11; P = 0.069) for left colon/rectum cancer. Ninety-two case patients (19.5%) and 173 control patients (34.0%) had screening sigmoidoscopy, corresponding to an AOR of 0.50 (CI, 0.36 to 0.70) overall, 0.79 (CI, 0.51 to 1.23) for right colon late-stage cancer, and 0.26 (CI, 0.14 to 0.48) for left colon cancer.

We longitudinally examined women and compared mammography use and cancer rates by HT use [current, former, and never users of estrogen + progestin (EPT) and estrogen only (ET)]. METHODS: We studied 163,490 unique women aged 50-79 years enrolled in Group Health (Washington State) between 1994-2009. Electronic data identified HT dispensing, mammography use and incident breast cancer diagnosis. We calculated age-adjusted screening compliance as a time-varying variable (screened-within-the-past-26 months, yes/no). RESULTS: Before 2002, screening compliance differed significantly by HT with current EPT users having the highest rates (83%) followed by former EPT (77%), current ET (77%), former ET (72%), and never users (56%). After 2002, screening was high ( approximately 81%) among current and former EPT and ET users and significantly increased among never users ( approximately 62%). Invasive breast cancer rates significantly decreased over the whole study period (P(trend) </= 0.05) for all HT users, except EPT current users (P(trend) = 0.68); DCIS rates did not change in any group. CONCLUSIONS: Differential screening mammography rates by HT use do not explain invasive breast cancer incidence declines.

However, the exact physiological pathways linking intestinal fat sensing to food intake and the activation of brain circuits remain to be identified. In this study we examined the role of triacylglycerol digestion for intestinal fat sensing, and compared the effects of the triacylglycerol digestion products, fatty acids and 2-monoacylglycerol, on behavioural, hormonal and dopaminergic responses in behaving mice. Using an operant task in which mice are trained to self-administer lipid emulsions directly into the stomach, we show that inhibiting triacylglycerol digestion disrupts normal behaviour of self-administration in mice, indicating that fat sensing is conditional to digestion. When administered separately, both digestion products, 2-monoacylglycerol and fatty acids, were sensed by the mice, and self-administration patterns of fatty acids were affected by the fatty acid chain length. Peripheral plasma concentrations of the gut hormones GLP-1, GIP, PYY, CCK and insulin did not offer an explanation of the differing behavioural effects produced by 2-monoacylglycerol and fatty acids. However, combined with behavioural responses, striatal dopamine effluxes induced by gut infusions of oleic acid were significantly greater than those produced by equivalent infusions of 2-oleoylglycerol. Our data demonstrate recruitment of different signalling pathways by fatty acids and 2-monoacylglycerol, and suggest that the structural properties of fat rather than total caloric value determine intestinal sensing and the assignment of reward value to lipids.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=25639597,0,1,0,0

In analyses of ovarian tumor specimens from a Mayo Clinic cohort of 490 patients, we further find that SPINK1 immunostaining represents an independent prognostic factor for poor survival, with the strongest association in patients with nonserous histological tumor subtypes (endometrioid, clear cell, and mucinous).

Little is known about vitamin D status, assessed by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], and its relationship to breast density in breast cancer survivors. METHODS: Participants were 426 postmenopausal breast cancer survivors from the Health, Eating, Activity, and Lifestyle Study. Women from New Mexico, Los Angeles, and western Washington were enrolled postdiagnosis. Data for this report are from an examination conducted 24 months postenrollment. Participants completed health-related questionnaires, gave fasting blood samples, and completed height and weight measurements. Serum [25(OH)D] was assayed by radioimmunoabsorbant assay. Breast dense area and percent density were measured from postdiagnosis-digitized mammograms. Multivariate linear regression tested associations of serum [25(OH)D] with mammographic breast density measures. RESULTS: Of the 426 participants, 22.8% were African-American, 11.3% were Hispanic, and 62.8% were non-Hispanic white.

We evaluate sex-specific associations with p53 mutations in colon cancer to add to understanding of these differences. Data from a large population-based incident case-control study of colon cancer were used to evaluate age and gender associations with p53 mutations. To obtain a better understanding of gender-specific associations, we evaluated the role of estrogen as a mediator of risk. For these analyses, women were classified as estrogen positive or negative, based on menopausal status and use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). RESULTS: There was a significant interaction between age and sex and risk of an acquired p53 mutation compared with p53 Wt. Among men, there was an increase in p53 mutations with age, whereas among women the opposite was observed. Associations with parity, oral contraceptive use, and total ovulatory months were not associated with p53 mutations. However, recent use of HRT reduced risk of all tumors, as did being estrogen positive. Women who were estrogen positive (either premenopausal or recent users of HRT) were at a significantly increased risk of an acquired p53 mutation if they consumed a diet with a high sugar index (odds ratio = 2.94; 95% confidence interval = 1.47-5.89); similar increases in risk of p53 mutations were not observed for men or women who were estrogen negative. CONCLUSIONS: Although sex-specific associations were detected for acquired p53 mutations, they do not indicate a unique role of estrogens in the mutation of p53.

DESIGN: Descriptive, correlational, cross-sectional study. SETTING: NHL survivors identified via the Los Angeles County Cancer Surveillance Program. SAMPLE: 222 NHL survivors two- to five-years postdiagnosis. METHODS: Data were collected via mailed questionnaire. Multivariate models were used to examine sexual well-being. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Three indices of sexual well-being were examined in relation to sociodemographic and medical variables: participation in sexual activity, satisfaction with sex life, and sexual function. FINDINGS: Most NHL survivors were participating in sexual activity; however, more than half were dissatisfied with their sex life. A substantial minority 'usually or always' experienced problems with sexual function. Associations between study variables and outcomes differed across indices of sexual well-being and by gender; older age was associated with decreased participation, decreased satisfaction, and impaired sexual function for men as well as with decreased participation for women. Poorer physical functioning was associated with decreased participation for men and women as well as poorer sexual function for women. Finally, poorer mental functioning was associated with less satisfaction and poorer sexual function for men and women; shorter times since diagnosis were associated with poorer sexual function for women. CONCLUSIONS: Most NHL survivors were sexually active, but many reported difficulties with satisfaction and function.

METHODS: We conducted 10 focus groups with patients recruited from the Duke University tumor registry and oncology/hematology clinics.

RESULTS: Participants not only reported causes of sleep disturbance common in other populations, such as pain and restless legs, but they also reported causes that may be unique to cancer populations, including abnormal dreams, anxiety about cancer diagnosis and recurrence, night sweats, and problems with sleep positioning. Many participants felt that sleep problems reduced their productivity, concentration, social interactions, and overall quality of life. Many also shared beliefs about the increased importance of sleep when fighting cancer.

Tob Control 2015;24",2015,Smokers' sensory beliefs mediate the relation between smoking a light/low tar cigarette and perceptions of harm,"BACKGROUND: The sensory belief that 'light/low tar' cigarettes are smoother can also influence the belief that 'light/low tar' cigarettes are less harmful. However, the 'light' concept is one of several factors influencing beliefs. No studies have examined the impact of the sensory belief about one's own brand of cigarettes on perceptions of harm. OBJECTIVE: The current study examines whether a smoker's sensory belief that their brand is smoother is associated with the belief that their brand is less harmful and whether sensory beliefs mediate the relation between smoking a 'light/low tar' cigarette and relative perceptions of harm among smokers in China. METHODS: Data are from 5209 smokers who were recruited using a stratified multistage sampling design and participated in Wave 3 of the International Tobacco Control (ITC) China Survey, a face-to-face survey of adult smokers and non-smokers in seven cities. RESULTS: Smokers who agreed that their brand of cigarettes was smoother were significantly more likely to say that their brand of cigarettes was less harmful (p<0.001, OR=6.86, 95% CI 5.64 to 8.33). Mediational analyses using the bootstrapping procedure indicated that both the direct effect of 'light/low tar' cigarette smokers on the belief that their cigarettes are less harmful (b=0.24, bootstrapped bias corrected 95% CI 0.13 to 0.34, p<0.001) and the indirect effect via their belief that their cigarettes are smoother were significant (b=0.32, bootstrapped bias-corrected 95% CI 0.28 to 0.37, p<0.001), suggesting that the mediation was partial. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the importance of implementing tobacco control policies that address the impact that cigarette design and marketing can have in capitalising on the smoker's natural associations between smoother sensations and lowered perceptions of harm.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=25370698,0,1,0,0

We aimed to describe adult smokers' social interactions about pictorial cigarette pack warnings in two longitudinal pilot studies. In Pilot Study 1, 30 smokers used cigarette packs with one of nine pictorial warnings for two weeks. In Pilot Study 2, 46 smokers used cigarette packs with one of five pictorial warnings for four weeks. Nearly all smokers (97%/96% in Pilot Study 1/2) talked about the warnings with other people, with the most common people being friends (67%/87%) and spouses/significant others (34%/42%). Pilot Study 2 found that 26% of smokers talked about the warnings with strangers. Discussions about the health effects of smoking and quitting smoking were more frequent during the first week of exposure to pictorial warnings than in the week prior to beginning the study (both p < 0.05). Pictorial warnings sparked social interactions about the warnings, the health effects of smoking, and quitting smoking, indicating that pictorial warnings may act as a social intervention reaching beyond the individual. Future research should examine social interactions as a potential mediator of the impact of pictorial warnings on smoking behavior.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26506363,1,1,0,0

J Med Internet Res 2015;17(10)",2015,Social listening: a content analysis of e-cigarette discussions on Twitter,"BACKGROUND: Electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use has increased in the United States, leading to active debate in the public health sphere regarding e-cigarette use and regulation. To better understand trends in e-cigarette attitudes and behaviors, public health and communication professionals can turn to the dialogue taking place on popular social media platforms such as Twitter. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to conduct a content analysis to identify key conversation trends and patterns over time using historical Twitter data. METHODS: A 5-category content analysis was conducted on a random sample of tweets chosen from all publicly available tweets sent between May 1, 2013, and April 30, 2014, that matched strategic keywords related to e-cigarettes. Relevant tweets were isolated from the random sample of approximately 10,000 tweets and classified according to sentiment, user description, genre, and theme. Descriptive analyses including univariate and bivariate associations, as well as correlation analyses were performed on all categories in order to identify patterns and trends. RESULTS: The analysis revealed an increase in e-cigarette-related tweets from May 2013 through April 2014, with tweets generally being positive; 71% of the sample tweets were classified as having a positive sentiment. The top two user categories were everyday people (65%) and individuals who are part of the e-cigarette community movement (16%). These two user groups were responsible for a majority of informational (79%) and news tweets (75%), compared to reputable news sources and foundations or organizations, which combined provided 5% of informational tweets and 12% of news tweets. Personal opinion (28%), marketing (21%), and first person e-cigarette use or intent (20%) were the three most common genres of tweets, which tended to have a positive sentiment. Marketing was the most common theme (26%), and policy and government was the second most common theme (20%), with 86% of these tweets coming from everyday people and the e-cigarette community movement combined, compared to 5% of policy and government tweets coming from government, reputable news sources, and foundations or organizations combined. CONCLUSIONS: Everyday people and the e-cigarette community are dominant forces across several genres and themes, warranting continued monitoring to understand trends and their implications regarding public opinion, e-cigarette use, and smoking cessation. Analyzing social media trends is a meaningful way to inform public health practitioners of current sentiments regarding e-cigarettes, and this study contributes a replicable methodology.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26508089,0,1,0,0

METHODS: Data on 80,855 AYAs with invasive cancer diagnosed in California 2001-2011 were obtained from the California Cancer Registry. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate overall survival. RESULTS: Associations of public or no insurance with greater risk of death were observed for 11 of 12 AYA cancers examined. Compared to Whites, Blacks experienced greater risk of death, regardless of age or insurance, while greater risk of death among Hispanics and Asians was more apparent for younger AYAs and for those with private/military insurance. More pronounced neighborhood SES disparities in survival were observed among AYAs with private/military insurance, especially among younger AYAs. CONCLUSIONS: Lacking or having public insurance was consistently associated with shorter survival, while disparities according to race/ethnicity and neighborhood SES were greater among AYAs with private/military insurance. While health insurance coverage associates with survival, remaining racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities among AYAs with cancer suggest additional social factors also need consideration in intervention and policy development.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Childhood cancer,"Behavioral Research Program, Healthcare Delivery Research Program, Surveillance Research Program",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28660357,0,1,0,1

Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 2013;22(6):1118-1128",2013,Solar UV radiation and cancer in young children,"BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that higher solar UV radiation exposure (UVR) may be related to lower risk of some cancers in adults. Recently, an ecologic study reported lower risks of some cancers among children living in higher UVR cities and countries. In a large population-based case-control study in California, we tested the hypothesis that childhood cancers may be influenced by UVR. METHODS: Cancers in children ages 0 to 5 years were identified from California Cancer Registry records for 1988 to 2007 and linked to birth certificate data. Controls were sampled from the birth certificates at a ratio of 20:1. Based on birth address, we assigned UVR exposure in units of Watt-hours/m(2) using a geostatistical exposure model developed with data from the National Solar Radiation Database. RESULTS: For cases with UVR exposure of 5,111 Watt-hours/m(2) or above, we estimated a reduction in odds of developing acute lymphoblastic leukemia (OR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.81-0.99), hepatoblastoma (OR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.48-1.00), and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (OR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.50-1.02) adjusting for mother's age, mother's race, and child's year of birth. We also observed a small increase in odds for intracranial/intraspinal embryonal tumors (OR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.01-1.65). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that UVR during pregnancy may decrease the odds of some childhood cancers. Future studies should explore additional factors that may be correlated with UVR exposure and possibly include biomarkers of immune function and vitamin D.

Technologic and methodologic developments have led to a revolutionary ability to examine dynamic, high-resolution measures of temporally matched location and behavior data through GPS, accelerometry, and GIS. These advances allow the investigation of spatial energetics, high-spatiotemporal resolution data on location and time-matched energetics, to examine how environmental characteristics, space, and time are linked to activity-related health behaviors with far more robust and detailed data than in previous work. Although the transdisciplinary field of spatial energetics demonstrates promise to provide novel insights on how individuals and populations interact with their environment, there remain significant conceptual, technical, analytical, and ethical challenges stemming from the complex data streams that spatial energetics research generates. First, it is essential to better understand what spatial energetics data represent, the relevant spatial context of analysis for these data, and if spatial energetics can establish causality for development of spatially relevant interventions. Second, there are significant technical problems for analysis of voluminous and complex data that may require development of spatially aware scalable computational infrastructures. Third, the field must come to agreement on appropriate statistical methodologies to account for multiple observations per person. Finally, these challenges must be considered within the context of maintaining participant privacy and security.

Little information is available about primary care physicians' current Papanicolaou (Pap) test screening practices, including initiation, frequency, and stopping. OBJECTIVE: To assess current Pap test screening practices in the United States. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Nationally representative sample of physicians during 2006 to 2007. PARTICIPANTS: 1212 primary care physicians. MEASUREMENTS: The survey included questions about physician and practice characteristics and recommendations for Pap screening presented as clinical vignettes describing women by age and by sexual and screening histories. A composite measure-guideline-consistent recommendations-was created by using responses to vignettes in which major guidelines were uniform. RESULTS: Most physicians reported providing Pap tests to their eligible patients (91.0% [95% CI, 89.0% to 92.6%]). Among Pap test providers (n = 1114), screening practices, including number of tests ordered or performed, use of patient reminder systems, and cytology method used, varied by physician specialty (P < 0.001). Although most Pap test providers reported that screening guidelines were very influential in their clinical practice, few had guideline-consistent recommendations for starting and stopping Pap screening across multiple vignettes (22.3% [CI, 19.9% to 25.0%]). Guideline-consistent recommendations varied by specialty (obstetrics/gynecology, 16.4%; internal medicine, 27.5%; and family or general practice, 21.1%). Compared with obstetricians/gynecologists, internal medicine specialists and family or general practice specialists were more likely to have guideline-consistent screening recommendations (odds ratio, 1.98 [CI, 1.22 to 3.23] and 1.45 [CI, 0.99 to 2.13], respectively) in multivariate analysis. LIMITATION: Physician self-report may reflect idealized rather than actual practice. CONCLUSION: Primary care physicians' recommendations for Pap test screening are not consistent with screening guidelines, reflecting overuse of screening. Implementation of effective interventions that focus on potentially modifiable physician and practice factors is needed to improve screening practice.

They frequently are used to help evaluate cancer treatments, as well as for supportive and palliative oncology care. To be most beneficial, these PROs must be relevant to patients and clinicians, valid, and easily understood and interpreted. The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Network, part of the National Institutes of Health Roadmap Initiative, aims to improve appreciably how PROs are selected and assessed in clinical research, including clinical trials. PROMIS is establishing a publicly available resource of standardized, accurate, and efficient PRO measures of major self-reported health domains (eg, pain, fatigue, emotional distress, physical function, social function) that are relevant across chronic illnesses including cancer. PROMIS is also developing measures of self-reported health domains specifically targeted to cancer, such as sleep/wake function, sexual function, cognitive function, and the psychosocial impacts of the illness experience (ie, stress response and coping; shifts in self-concept, social interactions, and spirituality). We outline the qualitative and quantitative methods by which PROMIS measures are being developed and adapted for use in clinical oncology research. At the core of this activity is the formation and application of item banks using item response theory modeling.

This study quantified how the disparities in CRC rates between Louisiana (a Southern state) and New Jersey (a Northeastern state) would be affected if differences in risk factors, screening, and stage-specific CRC relative survival between the states were eliminated. METHODS: This study used the Microsimulation Screening Analysis Colon microsimulation model to estimate age-adjusted CRC incidence and mortality rates in Louisiana from 1995 to 2009 under the assumption that 1) Louisiana had the same smoking and obesity prevalence observed in New Jersey, 2) Louisiana had the same CRC screening uptake observed in New Jersey, 3) Louisiana had the same stage-specific CRC relative survival observed in New Jersey, or 4) all the preceding were true. RESULTS: In 2009, the observed CRC incidence and mortality rates in Louisiana were 141.4 cases and 61.9 deaths per 100,000 individuals, respectively. With the same risk factors and screening observed in New Jersey, the CRC incidence rate in Louisiana was reduced by 3.5% and 15.2%, respectively. New Jersey's risk factors, screening, and survival reduced the CRC mortality rate in Louisiana by 3.0%, 10.8%, and 17.4%, respectively. With all trends combined, the modeled rates per 100,000 individuals in Louisiana became lower than the observed rates in New Jersey for both incidence (116.4 vs 130.0) and mortality (44.7 vs 55.8). CONCLUSIONS: The disparities in CRC incidence and mortality rates between Louisiana and New Jersey could be eliminated if Louisiana could attain New Jersey's levels of risk factors, screening, and survival.

However, there are few data from adequately powered cohort studies of subjects with BE. METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study of a cohort of BE patients identified from national Veteran Affairs (VA) outpatient files, diagnosed with BE from 2004 through 2009. New cases of EAC recorded after BE diagnosis were identified during a follow-up period that ended in 2011 and verified using electronic medical records. We selected patients with BE without EAC (controls) using incidence density sampling; 3 controls were matched to each case based on birth year and date of BE diagnosis. Our analysis included only male patients with at least 1 VA visit per year of follow up. We identified prescriptions for statins and non-statin lipid lowering medications filled after BE diagnosis and up to 90 days before EAC diagnosis for cases and controls (during the corresponding time period); we examined the association between statin use and EAC in conditional logistic regression models. RESULTS: We compared 311 EAC cases to 856 controls. Cases were less likely to use any statins than controls (40.2% vs 54.0%; P < .01). Significantly lower proportions of cases used statins for 6-18 months (10.0% cases vs 17.1% controls) and >18 months (19.3% vs 24.0%, respectively; P < .01). Simvastatin was the most commonly prescribed statin (accounting for 86.9% of statin use); the defined daily dose of simvastatin was lower in cases than in controls (21-40 mg/day, 9.3% vs 14.5%, respectively; and >40 mg/day, 8.4% vs 12.6%, respectively; P < .01). In multivariate analysis, statin use was inversely associated with development of EAC (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.47-0.91). This protective association was strongest for patients with advanced-stage EAC: in a stratified analysis, comparison of 189 cases with stage 0-1 EAC to 520 controls produced an adjusted OR of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.54-1.33). Among patients with late-stage EAC (stages 2-4, n = 106) and 291 controls, the adjusted OR was 0.44 (95% CI, 0.25-0.79). We found no association between EAC and non-statin lipid-lowering medications.

Recent statistical approaches allow for the estimation of intraindividual cortisol variability (""ICV"") and a greater ICV has been observed in some mood disorders (major depression, remitted bipolar disorder); however, ICV has not been examined following stress management. In this secondary analyses of an efficacious randomized clinical trial, we examine how ICV may change after cognitive behavioral stress management (CBSM) among healthy stressed women at risk for breast cancer. Second, we concurrently compare other calculations of cortisol that may change following CBSM. METHODS: Multilevel modeling (MLM) was applied to estimate ICV and to test for a group by time interaction from baseline, post-intervention, to 1 month following CBSM. Forty-four women were randomized to the CBSM; 47 to the comparison group; mean age of the entire group was 44.2 (SD=10.27). RESULTS: After controlling for relevant covariates, a significant time by group interaction emerged (beta estimate=-.070; p<.05), such that CBSM participants demonstrated a lower ICV following CBSM compared to the comparison group. The interaction for cortisol slope and cortisol output (area under the curve) approached significance (beta estimates=-.10 and -.062, respectively; p's<.08), while other cortisol outcomes tested were not significantly changed following CBSM. CONCLUSION: ICV may represent a novel index of cortisol dysregulation that is impacted by CBSM and may represent a more malleable within-person calculation than other, widely applied cortisol outcomes. Future research should examine these relationships in larger samples, and examine ICV and health outcomes.

The authors report data from the Observing Protein and Energy Nutrition (OPEN) Study, conducted from September 1999 to March 2000, in which valid reference biomarkers for energy (doubly labeled water) and protein (urinary nitrogen), together with a FFQ and 24HR, were observed in 484 healthy volunteers from Montgomery County, Maryland. Accounting for the reference biomarkers, the data suggest that the FFQ leads to severe attenuation in estimated disease relative risks for absolute protein or energy intake (a true relative risk of 2 would appear as 1.1 or smaller). For protein adjusted for energy intake by using either nutrient density or nutrient residuals, the attenuation is less severe (a relative risk of 2 would appear as approximately 1.3), lending weight to the use of energy adjustment. Using the 24HR as a reference instrument can seriously underestimate true attenuation (up to 60% for energy-adjusted protein). Results suggest that the interpretation of findings from FFQ-based epidemiologic studies of diet-disease associations needs to be reevaluated","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,"Methods and Technology, Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=12835281,0,1,0,0

However, the completeness of these data has not been evaluated. METHODS: Using linked SEER-Medicare data, a cohort was created that included incident cases of breast, endometrial, lung, prostate, or rectal cancer from 1991 to 1996 in persons 65 years and older. For each of these cases, use of radiation therapy as an initial course of treatment reported from the SEER data was compared with use of radiation therapy in the months following diagnosis, as determined from the Medicare claims. RESULTS: Overall, there was a high agreement between SEER and Medicare sources for use of radiation therapy. Agreement was 88% for lung cancer, 93% for prostate cancer, 94% for rectal and breast cancers, and 95% for endometrial cancer. Within the Medicare files, radiation claims were found in MedPAR Physician Supplier Part B and Outpatient files. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high level of agreement between SEER and Medicare reporting of radiation treatments after a cancer diagnosis, suggesting that either source can be used to assess radiation-related treatment patterns.

METHODS: We describe an analysis of cross-sectional data from 443 children enrolled in the prospective Study of Nevi in Children. To evaluate the joint effect, we partitioned the sum of squares because of interaction between sunburn and sun exposure into orthogonal components representing (1) monotonic increase in log nevi with increasing sun exposure (rate of increase of log nevi depends on sunburn), and (2) nonmonotonic pattern. RESULTS: In unadjusted analyses, there was a marginally significant monotonic pattern of interaction (P = .08). In adjusted analyses, sun exposure was associated with higher log nevi among those without sunburn (P < .001), but not among those with sunburn (P = .14). Sunburn was independently associated with log nevi (P = .02), even though sun sensitivity explained 29% (95% confidence interval: 2%-56%, P = .04) of its effect. Children with high sun sensitivity and sunburn had more nevi, regardless of sun exposure. CONCLUSIONS: A program of increasing sun protection in early childhood as a strategy for reducing nevi, when applied to the general population, may not equally benefit everyone.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Skin,Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26096189,0,0,1,0

The purpose of the current study was to estimate the impact of endoscopic surveillance on colorectal cancer-specific survival for persons with localized or regional colorectal cancer. The population included Medicare patients (age >or=65 years) who were diagnosed with local or regional stage colorectal cancer between 1986 and 1996. METHODS: The current study was a retrospective case-control study. Cases were defined as those individuals who died of colorectal cancer and controls were defined as those with colorectal cancer who did not die of colorectal cancer; controls were frequency matched to cases. Surveillance was defined as the use of colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy, or barium enema >or=6 months after diagnosis. Logistic regression was used to control for endoscopic procedure, race, comorbidity index at the time of diagnosis, and types of initial treatments after surgery. RESULTS: The analysis group contained 8130 cases (29%) and 20,079 controls (71%). The average time to first bowel surveillance for those with at least 1 surveillance examination was 15.9 months after the diagnosis (median, 13 months). In the regression analysis, surveillance endoscopy was not found to be associated with improved colorectal cancer-specific survival (odds ratio of 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 0.95-1.06 [P=0.85]). Setting the surveillance interval to 12 months and 15 months rather than 6 months after diagnosis did not appear to influence the results.

This study compares youth estimates of SB and moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) obtained using raw and count-based processing methods. METHODS: Data were collected between April and October 2014 for the National Cancer Institute's Family Life, Activity, Sun, Health, and Eating Study: a cross-sectional Internet-based study of youth/family cancer prevention behaviors. A subsample of 628 adolescents (aged 12-17 years) wore the ActiGraph GT3X+ on the wrist for 7 days. In 2015-2016, SB and MVPA time were calculated from raw data using R-package GGIR and from activity counts data using published cutpoints (Crouter and Chandler). Estimates were compared across age, sex, and weight status to examine the impact of processing methods on behavioral outcomes. RESULTS: ActiGraph data were available for 408 participants. Large differences in SB and MVPA time were observed between processing methods, but age and gender patterns were similar. Younger children (aged 12-14 years) had lower sedentary time and greater MVPA time (p-values <0.05) than older children (aged 15-17 years), consistent across methods. The proportion of youth with >/=60 minutes of MVPA/day was highest with the Crouter methods (~50%) and lowest with GGIR (~0%). CONCLUSIONS: Conclusions about youth PA and SB are influenced by the wrist-worn accelerometer data processing method. Efforts to harmonize processing methods are needed to promote standardization and facilitate reporting of monitor-based PA data.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=28526364,1,0,1,0

METHODS: The authors studied 2886 stage II and III rectal cancer patients who had surgical resection and who appeared in 1992-1999 linked SEER-Medicare claims data. The authors compared measures of adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy receipt and completion between stage II and III patients. Adjusted risk of cancer-related 5-year mortality was calculated by multivariate logistic regression for different levels of chemoradiation adherence among stage II and III patients. RESULTS: Of the 2886 patients, 45.4% received both adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy. Stage III patients were more likely to receive chemoradiation than stage II patients. The receipt of chemoradiation by stage II patients increased significantly from 1992 to 1999. Stage III patients were more likely to complete radiation therapy (96.6%), chemotherapy (68.2%), and both modalities (67.5%) than stage II patients (91.5%, 49.8%, 47.6%, respectively). Only a complete course of both radiation and chemotherapy for both stage II (relative risk [RR] 0.74; 95% CI, 0.54, 0.97) and III (RR 0.80; 95% CI, 0.65, 0.96) decreased the adjusted 5-year cancer mortality risk compared with counterparts with no adjuvant therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Even though stage II rectal cancer patients were less likely than stage III patients to receive and complete adjuvant chemoradiation, both patient groups in the general population had lower cancer-related mortality if they completed chemoradiation.

METHODS: The established SimSmoke model was adapted with population, smoking rates and tobacco control policy data from Sweden. SimSmoke evaluates the effect of taxes, smoke-free air, mass media, marketing bans, warning labels, cessation treatment and youth access policies on smoking and snus prevalence and the number of deaths attributable to smoking and snus use by gender from 2010 to 2040. RESULTS: Sweden SimSmoke estimates that significant inroads to reducing smoking and snus prevalence and premature mortality can be achieved through tax increases, especially when combined with other policies. Smoking prevalence can be decreased by as much as 26% in the first few years, reaching a 37% reduction within 30 years. Without effective tobacco control policies, almost 54 500 lives will be lost in Sweden due to tobacco use by the year 2040.

This study examined how overweight long-term survivors' symptom severity associated with comorbidity prior to a diet and exercise intervention was associated with post-intervention function and examined symptoms' effects on function through change in physical activity, diet quality, and weight status. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a secondary data analysis of 514 breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer survivors who participated in the one-year home-based diet and exercise intervention Reach-Out to Enhance Wellness trial. Measures included symptoms, weight, physical activity, diet quality, overall physical function (PF), and basic and advanced lower extremity function (BLEF and ALEF). Simple and serial mediation analyses were conducted to examine direct effects of symptom severity on PF, BLEF, and ALEF and indirect effects of symptom severity through changes in diet quality, physical activity, and weight. RESULTS: Symptom severity was directly associated with lower functioning scores for PF (b=-0.63 p<0.001), BLEF (b=-0.33, p<0.001), and ALEF (b=-0.22, p<0.001). Indirect effects of symptom severity through weight loss, physical activity, and diet were not significant. Weight loss and physical activity were associated with higher PF and ALEF and diet quality was associated with higher BLEF. CONCLUSION: Symptom severity of older, overweight cancer survivors negatively affects physical function.

Specifically, it explored whether conversations about campaign ads and/or about quitting mediated campaign exposure effects on 2 quitting behaviors (sought help to quit and tried to quit smoking completely), as well as the relation between ad-related and quitting-related conversations. Data were collected before the campaign and monthly for 16 months during the campaign through cross-sectional telephone surveys among a sample of 3,277 adult Philadelphia smokers. Follow-up interviews were conducted among 877 participants 3 months after their first survey. Cross-sectional and longitudinal mediation models with bootstrap procedures assessed the indirect effects of campaign exposure on outcomes through conversations, and the indirect effects of conversations about ads on outcomes through conversations about quitting. In addition, lagged regression analyses tested the causal direction of associations between the variables of interest. The results partially support hypotheses that conversations about quitting mediate campaign effects on quitting-related behaviors and, in line with previous research, that conversations about the ads have indirect effects on quitting-related behaviors by triggering conversations about quitting. These findings demonstrate the importance of considering interpersonal communication as a route of campaign exposure effects when evaluating and designing future public health campaigns.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26147367,1,0,1,0

Am J Prev Med 2015;49(5):765-771",2015,Targeted cancer screening in average-risk individuals,"Targeted cancer screening refers to use of disease risk information to identify those most likely to benefit from screening. Researchers have begun to explore the possibility of refining screening regimens for average-risk individuals using genetic and non-genetic risk factors and previous screening experience. Average-risk individuals are those not known to be at substantially elevated risk, including those without known inherited predisposition, without comorbidities known to increase cancer risk, and without previous diagnosis of cancer or pre-cancer. In this paper, we describe the goals of targeted cancer screening in average-risk individuals, present factors on which cancer screening has been targeted, discuss inclusion of targeting in screening guidelines issued by major U.S. professional organizations, and present evidence to support or question such inclusion. Screening guidelines for average-risk individuals currently target age; smoking (lung cancer only); and, in some instances, race; family history of cancer; and previous negative screening history (cervical cancer only). No guidelines include common genomic polymorphisms. RCTs suggest that targeting certain ages and smoking histories reduces disease-specific cancer mortality, although some guidelines extend ages and smoking histories based on statistical modeling. Guidelines that are based on modestly elevated disease risk typically have either no or little evidence of an ability to affect a mortality benefit. In time, targeted cancer screening is likely to include genetic factors and past screening experience as well as non-genetic factors other than age, smoking, and race, but it is of utmost importance that clinical implementation be evidence-based.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26165196,0,0,0,0

DESIGN: Population-based survey. SETTING: United States. PARTICIPANTS: Community dwelling U.S. women aged 75 and older who participated in the 2008 or 2010 National Health Interview Survey. MEASUREMENTS: Using a previously developed and validated index, women were categorized according to life expectancy (>9, 5-9, <5 years). Receipt of mammography screening in the past 2 years was examined according to life expectancy, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, access to care, preventive orientation (e.g., receipt of influenza vaccination), and receipt of a clinician recommendation for screening. RESULTS: Of 2,266 respondents, 27.1% had a life expectancy of greater than 9 years, 53.4% had a life expectancy of 5 to 9 years, and 19.5% had a life expectancy of less than 5 years. Overall, 55.7% reported receiving mammography screening in the past 2 years. Life expectancy was strongly associated with receipt of screening (P < .001), yet 36.1% of women with less than 5 years life expectancy were screened, and 29.2% of women with more than 9 years life expectancy were not screened. A clinician recommendation for screening was the strongest predictor of screening independent of life expectancy. Higher educational attainment, age, receipt of influenza vaccination, and history of benign breast biopsy were also independently associated with being screened. CONCLUSION: Despite uncertainty of benefit, many women aged 75 and older are screened with mammography. Life expectancy is strongly associated with receipt of screening, which may reflect clinicians and patients appropriately considering life expectancy in screening decisions, but 36% of women with short life expectancies are still screened, suggesting that new interventions are needed to further improve targeting of screening according to life expectancy.

RESULTS: Surgery among stage I/II patients decreased non-significantly overtime (1996: 78.8%; 2010: 68.5%; p=0.18), whereas receipt of chemotherapy among stage IIIB/IV patients increased significantly overtime (1996: 36.1%; 2010: 51.2%; p<0.01).

Median survival improved non-significantly among stage I/II patients from 51 to 64 months (p=0.75) and significantly among IIIB/IV patients from 4 to 5 months (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Treatment disparities were observed in both stage groups, notably among older patients. Among stage I/II patients, survival did not change significantly possibly due to stable surgery utilization. Among stage IIIB/IV patients, although the use of chemotherapy increased and survival improved, the one-month increase in median survival highlights the need for addition research.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Lung,"Behavioral Research Program, Healthcare Delivery Research Program, Surveillance Research Program",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=28024699,0,0,1,0

TERT gene harbors multiple variants associated with pancreatic cancer susceptibility. Int J Cancer 2015;137(9):2175-2183",2015,TERT gene harbors multiple variants associated with pancreatic cancer susceptibility,"A small number of common susceptibility loci have been identified for pancreatic cancer, one of which is marked by rs401681 in the TERT-CLPTM1L gene region on chromosome 5p15.33. Because this region is characterized by low linkage disequilibrium, we sought to identify whether additional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) could be related to pancreatic cancer risk, independently of rs401681. We performed an in-depth analysis of genetic variability of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and the telomerase RNA component (TERC) genes, in 5,550 subjects with pancreatic cancer and 7,585 controls from the PANcreatic Disease ReseArch (PANDoRA) and the PanScan consortia. We identified a significant association between a variant in TERT and pancreatic cancer risk (rs2853677, odds ratio = 0.85; 95% confidence interval = 0.80-0.90, p = 8.3 x 10(-8)).

Clin Cancer Res 2015;21(22):5173-5180",2015,TERT polymorphism rs2736100-C is associated with EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer,"PURPOSE: EGF receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive (EGFRmut(+)) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) may be a unique orphan disease. Previous studies suggested that the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene polymorphism is associated with demographic and clinical features strongly associated with EGFR mutations, for example, adenocarcinoma histology, never-smoking history, and female gender. We aim to test the association between TERT polymorphism and EGFRmut(+) NSCLC. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We conducted a genetic association study in Chinese patients with NSCLC (n = 714) and healthy controls (n = 2,520), between the rs2736100 polymorphism and EGFRmut(+) NSCLC. We further tested the association between the EGFR mutation status and mean leukocyte telomere length (LTL). The potential function of rs2736100 in lung epithelial cells was also explored. RESULTS: The rs2736100-C allele was significantly associated with EGFRmut(+) NSCLC [OR, 1.52; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.28-1.80; P = 1.6 x 10(-6)] but not EGFRmut(-) NSCLC (OR = 1.07, 95% CI, 0.92-1.24, P = 0.4). While patients with NSCLC as a whole have significantly longer LTL than healthy controls (P </= 10(-13)), the EGFRmut(+) patients have even longer LTL than EGFRmut(-) patients (P = 0.008). Meanwhile, rs2736100 was significantly associated with TERT mRNA expression in both normal and tumor lung tissues. All results remained significant after controlling for age, gender, smoking status, and histology (P < 0.05 for all tests). Moreover, the rs2736100 DNA sequence has an allele-specific affinity to nuclear proteins extracted from lung epithelial cells, which led to an altered enhancer activity of the sequence in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that telomerase and telomere function may be essential for carcinogenesis of EGFRmut(+) NSCLC. Further investigation for the underlying mechanism is warranted.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Lung,Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26149460,0,1,1,0

To better understand the effects of motivational calls and to maximize adherence, we conducted a randomized trial among women aged 50-79 years. METHODS: We created a stratified random sample of 5062 women due for mammograms within the Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound, including 4099 women with prior mammography and 963 without it. We recruited and surveyed 3743 (74%) of the women before mailing a recommendation. After 2 months, 1765 (47%) of the 3743 women had not scheduled a mammogram and were randomly assigned to one of three intervention groups: a reminder post-card group (n = 590), a reminder telephone call group (n = 585), and a motivational telephone call addressing barriers group (n = 590). The telephone callers could schedule mammography. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for documented mammography use by 1 year. RESULTS: Women who received reminder calls were more likely to get mammograms (HR = 1.9; 95% CI = 1.6-2.4) than women who were mailed postcards. The motivational and reminder calls (average length, 8.5 and 3.1 minutes, respectively) had equivalent effects (HR = 0.97; 95% CI = 0.8-1.2). After we controlled for the intervention effect, women with prior mammography (n = 1277) were much more likely to get a mammogram (HR = 3.4; 95% CI = 2.7-4.3) than women without prior use (n = 488).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We created a stratified random sample of screening mammograms weighted with difficult cases split evenly among women with fatty breast tissue and those with dense breast tissue: 114 patients were cancer-free, 114 had cancer 1 year after screening, and 113 had cancer 13-24 months after screening. In test settings 6 months apart, 19 community radiologists interpreted 341 bilateral screening mammograms with and without CAD. We compared the sensitivity and specificity using regression models adjusting for repeated measures. RESULTS: CAD assistance did not affect overall sensitivity (cancer by 1 year: 63.2% without CAD and 62.0% with CAD; cancer in 13-24 months: 33.5% without CAD and 32.3% with CAD), but its effect differed for visible masses that were marked by CAD compared with those that were not marked by CAD (hereafter referred to as 'unmarked'). CAD was associated with improved sensitivity for marked visible cancers and decreased sensitivity for unmarked visible masses; the sensitivities without and with CAD, respectively, were as follows: marked cancer by 1 year, 82.7% versus 83.1%; marked cancer in 13-24 months, 44.2% versus 57.9%; unmarked cancer by 1 year, 37.4% versus 30.1%; unmarked cancer in 13-24 months, 29.7% versus 23.0% (p < 0.03 for both interactions between assistance and CAD marking for cancer by 1 year and cancer in 13-24 months). CAD marked 77% (70/91) of the visible cancers by 1 year and 67.3% (37/55) of the visible cancers in 13-24 months. CAD marked more visible calcified lesions (86%) than masses and asymmetric densities (67%) (p < 0.05). Overall specificity was 72% without and 75% with CAD (p < 0.02). CAD had a greater effect on both specificity (p < 0.02) and sensitivity (p < 0.03) among radiologists who interpret more than 50 mammograms per week. The results were the same for fatty breast tissue and dense breast tissue. CONCLUSION: In this experiment, CAD increased interpretive specificity but did not affect sensitivity because visible noncalcified lesions that went unmarked by CAD were less likely to be assessed as abnormal by radiologists.

DESIGN: Study design was a randomized control trial with a 6-month follow-up assessment of smoking status. SETTING: Zhejiang, Heilongjiang, and Shaanxi provinces in China provided the study setting. SUBJECTS: A total of 8000 adult smokers in China who used Nokia Life Tools and participated in phase 2 (smoking education via text message) of the study were included. INTERVENTION: The high-frequency text contact (HFTC) group received one to three messages daily containing smoking cessation advice, encouragement, and health education information. The low-frequency text contact (LFTC) group received one weekly message with smoking health effects information. MEASURES: Our primary outcome was smoking status at 0, 1, 3, and 6 months after intervention. Secondary outcomes include participant perceptions of the HFTC intervention, and factors associated with smoking cessation among HFTC participants. ANALYSIS: Descriptive and chi2 analyses were conducted to assess smoking status and acceptability. Factors associated with quitting were assessed using multiple logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Quit rates were high in both the HFTC and LFTC groups (HFTC: 0 month, 27.9%; 1 month, 30.5%; 3 months, 26.7%; and 6 months, 27.7%; LFTC: 0 month, 26.7%; 1 month, 30.4%; 3 months, 28.1%; and 6 months, 27.7%), with no significant difference between the two groups in an intent-to-treat analysis.

Several observational studies have found that women, who are overweight or obese at the time of diagnosis, as well as those who gain weight after diagnosis, are at greater risk for breast cancer recurrence and death than non-overweight women. DESIGN: Prospective cohort of breast cancer cases. SUBJECTS: 219 African-American breast cancer patients participating in the Los Angeles component of the Health, Eating, Activity and Lifestyle Study. MEASURES: ADRB3 Trp64Arg genotype, measures of weight including body mass index (BMI), weight gain (weight 5 years before diagnosis compared with weight at 30 months after diagnosis), obesity (BMI> or =30 kg/m(2)), waist/hip circumference and visceral or subcutaneous fat were determined by magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: African-American women who were homozygous for the ADRB3 wild-type allele had significantly higher mean visceral fat levels than women who carried the variant (P=0.04), and were significantly more likely to be obese (odd ratios (OR)=2.1, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.1-4.2).

The influence of obesity on the accuracy of screening mammography has not been studied extensively. METHODS: We analyzed 100 622 screening mammography examinations performed on members of a nonprofit health plan. The relationship between body mass index (weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) and measures of screening accuracy was assessed. Body mass index was categorized as underweight or normal weight (<25), overweight (25-29), obesity class I (30-34), and obesity classes II to III (> or =35). RESULTS: Compared with underweight or normal weight women, overweight and obese women were more likely to be recalled for additional tests after adjusting for important covariates, including age and breast density (overweight odds ratio [OR], 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-1.23); obesity class I OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.19-1.35; obesity classes II-III OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.22-1.41).

In a multiethnic, prospective cohort of breast cancer survivors, we hypothesized that television watching time would be independently associated with an increased risk of death from any cause. METHODS: The Health, Eating, Activity, and Lifestyle Study cohort included 687 women diagnosed with local or regional breast cancer. On average 30 (+/-4) months postdiagnosis, women completed self-report assessments on time spent sitting watching television/videos in a typical day in the previous year. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for death from any cause (n = 89) during the 7 years of follow-up. RESULTS: Television time (top tertile vs. bottom tertile) was positively related to risk of death (HR, 1.94; 95 % CI, 1.02, 3.66, p trend = 0.024), but the association was attenuated and not statistically significant after adjustment for aerobic moderate-vigorous intensity physical activity (HR, 1.70; 95 % CI, 0.89, 3.22, p trend = 0.14) and all covariates (HR, 1.39; 95 % CI, 0.69, 2.82, p trend = 0.48).

OBJECTIVE: To validate the 2012 version of the Automated Self-Administered 24-Hour Dietary Recall for Children (ASA24-Kids-2012), a self-administered web-based 24-hour dietary recall (24hDR) instrument, among children aged 9 to 11 years, in two sites. DESIGN: Quasiexperimental. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: In one site, trained staff members observed and recorded foods and drinks consumed by children (n=38) during school lunch. The next day, the observed children completed both ASA24-Kids-2012 and an interviewer-administered 24hDR in a randomized order. Procedures in a second site (n=31) were similar, except observations occurred during dinner in a community location. STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Foods were classified as matches (reported and consumed), intrusions (reported, but not consumed), or omissions (not reported, but consumed) for each participant. Rates of matches, intrusions, and omissions were calculated. Rates were compared between each recall method using repeated measures analysis of covariance. For matched foods, the authors determined correlation coefficients between observed and reported serving sizes. RESULTS: Match, intrusion, and omission rates between ASA24-Kids-2012 and observed intakes in Site 1 were 37%, 27%, and 35%, respectively. Comparable rates for interviewer-administered 24hDRs were 57%, 20%, and 23%, respectively. In Site 2, match, intrusion, and omission rates between ASA24-Kids-2012 and observed intakes were 53%, 12%, and 36%, respectively, vs 76% matches, 9% intrusions, and 15% omissions for interviewer-administered 24hDRs.

Increase in BMI has been associated with a decrease in percent density, but the effect on change in absolute dense area or volume is unclear. METHODS: We examined the association between change in BMI and change in volumetric breast density among 24,556 women in the San Francisco Mammography Registry from 2007 to 2013. Height and weight were self-reported at the time of mammography. Breast density was assessed using single x-ray absorptiometry measurements. Cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between BMI and dense volume (DV), non-dense volume (NDV), and percent dense volume (PDV) were assessed using multivariable linear regression models, adjusted for demographics, risk factors, and reproductive history. RESULTS: In cross-sectional analysis, BMI was positively associated with DV [beta, 2.95 cm(3); 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.69-3.21] and inversely associated with PDV (beta, -2.03%; 95% CI, -2.09, -1.98).

These findings were consistent for both pre- and postmenopausal women. CONCLUSION: Our findings support an inverse association between change in BMI and change in PDV.

We used multivariable regression to examine the association of cigarette price and smoke-free home policies on these outcomes. RESULTS: High state cigarette price (pack price >/= $4.50) was associated with lower consumption across all income levels. Although low-income individuals were least likely to adopt smoke-free homes, those who adopted them had consumption levels and successful quit rates that were similar to those among higher-income individuals. In multivariable analysis, both policies were independently associated with lower consumption, but only smoke-free homes were associated with sustained cessation at 90 days. CONCLUSIONS: High cigarette prices and especially smoke-free homes have the potential to reduce smoking behaviors among low-income individuals.

To estimate the prevalence of unsuspected prostate cancer, we reviewed 19 studies of prostate cancer discovered at autopsy among 6,024 men. Among men aged 70-79, tumor was found in 36% of Caucasians and 51% of African-Americans. This enormous prevalence, coupled with the high sensitivity of PSA screening, has led to the marked increase in the apparent incidence of prostate cancer. The impact of PSA screening on clinical practice is well-recognized, but its effect on epidemiologic research is less appreciated. Before screening, a larger proportion of incident prostate cancers had lethal potential and were diagnosed at advanced stage. However, in the PSA era, overall incident prostate cancer mainly is indolent disease, and often reflects the propensity to be screened and biopsied. Studies must therefore focus on cancers with lethal potential, and include long follow-up to accommodate the lead time induced by screening. Moreover, risk factor patterns differ markedly for potentially lethal and indolent disease, suggesting separate etiologies and distinct disease entities. Studies of total incident or indolent prostate cancer are of limited clinical utility, and the main focus of research should be on prostate cancers of lethal potential.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Prostate, Male Genital Organs",Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=25557753,0,0,0,0

Polymorphisms mapping to microRNA (miRNA) binding sites have been shown to disrupt the ability of miRNAs to target genes resulting in differential mRNA and protein expression. Skin tumor susceptibility 5 (Skts5) was identified as a locus conferring susceptibility to chemically-induced skin cancer in NIH/Ola by SPRET/Outbred F1 backcrosses. To determine if polymorphisms between the strains which mapped to putative miRNA binding sites in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of genes at Skts5 influenced expression, we conducted a systematic evaluation of 3'UTRs of candidate genes across this locus. Nine genes had polymorphisms in their 3'UTRs which fit the linkage data and eight of these contained polymorphisms suspected to interfere with or introduce miRNA binding. 3'UTRs of six genes, Bcap29, Dgkb, Hbp1, Pik3cg, Twistnb, and Tspan13 differentially affected luciferase expression, but did not appear to be differentially regulated by the evaluated miRNAs predicted to bind to only one of the two isoforms. 3'UTRs from four additional genes chosen from the locus that fit less stringent criteria were evaluated. Ifrd1 and Etv1 showed differences and contained polymorphisms predicted to disrupt or create miRNA binding sites but showed no difference in regulation by the miRNAs tested. In summary, multiple 3'UTRs with putative functional variants between susceptible and resistant strains of mice influenced differential expression independent of predicted miRNA binding.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=23472213,0,1,1,0

There is uncertainty in the published literature as to which colonoscopy examinations should be excluded when measuring a physician's ADR. OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of varying the colonoscopy exclusion criteria on physician ADR. DESIGN: We applied different exclusion criteria used in 30 previous studies to a dataset of endoscopy and pathology reports. Under each exclusion criterion, we calculated physician ADR. SETTING: A private practice colonoscopy center affiliated with the University of Illinois College of Medicine. PATIENTS: Data on 20,040 colonoscopy examinations performed by 11 gastroenterologists from July 2009 to May 2013 and associated pathology notes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: ADRs across all colonoscopy examinations, each physician's ADR, and ADR ranking. RESULTS: There were 28 different exclusion criteria used when measuring the ADR. Each study used a different combination of these exclusion criteria. The proportion of all colonoscopy examinations in the dataset excluded under these combinations of exclusion criteria ranged from 0% to 92.2%. The mean ADR across all colonoscopy examinations was 39.1%. The change in mean ADR after applying the 28 exclusion criteria ranged from -5.5 to +3.0 percentage points. However, the exclusion criteria affected each physician's ADR relatively equally, and therefore physicians' rankings via the ADR were stable. LIMITATIONS: ADR assessment was limited to a single private endoscopy center. CONCLUSION: There is wide variation in the exclusion criteria used when measuring the ADR. Although these exclusion criteria can affect overall ADRs, the relative rankings of physicians by ADR were stable. A consensus definition of which exclusion criteria are applied when measuring ADR is needed.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Colon, Digestive Organs",Healthcare Delivery Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26385275,0,0,0,0

In this explorative study, we quantified how this uncertainty affects the estimates of effectiveness and efficiency of screening and treatment for EAC. DESIGN: We developed 3 versions of the University of Washington / Microsimulation Screening Analysis-EAC model. The models differed with respect to the annual progression rate from BE to EAC (0.12% or 0.42%) and the possibility of spontaneous regression of dysplasia (yes or no). All versions of the model were calibrated to the observed Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results esophageal cancer incidence rates from 1998 to 2009. To identify the impact of natural history, we estimated the incidence and deaths prevented as well as numbers needed to screen (NNS) and treat (NNT) of a one-time perfect screening at age 65 years that detected all prevalent BE cases, followed by a perfect treatment intervention. RESULTS: Assuming a perfect screening and treatment intervention for all patients with BE, the maximum EAC mortality reduction (64%-66%) and the NNS per death prevented (470-510) were similar across the 3 model versions. However, 3 times more people needed to be treated to prevent 1 death (24 v. 8) in the 0.12% regression model compared with the 0.42% progression model. Restricting treatment to those with dysplasia or only high-grade dysplasia resulted in smaller differences in NNT (2-3 to prevent one EAC case) but wider variation in effectiveness (mortality reduction of 15%-24%). CONCLUSION: The uncertainty in the natural history of the BE to EAC sequence influenced the estimates of effectiveness and efficiency of BE screening and treatment considerably. This uncertainty could seriously hamper decision making about implementing BE screening and treatment interventions.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Esophagus, Digestive Organs",Surveillance Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=25277672,0,0,1,0

Methods: Patients aged >/=60 years with stage 0-3 breast cancer (n = 371) and matched non-cancer controls (n = 370) completed 13 neuropsychological tests prior to systemic therapy or at enrollment (controls). The tests captured three domains: attention, processing speed and executive function; learning and memory; and visual-spatial function. Domain-specific impairment was defined as having one test score 2 SD below or two or more test scores 1.5 SD below the reference population means. Different reference populations were used to define impairment: published normative data, study-specific controls, age and education-stratified controls, and age and education-adjusted controls. The associations between the resultant impairment rates and breast cancer (vs. control) were evaluated using chi-square tests and logistic regression models. Cohen's kappa coefficients were used to evaluate agreement of impairment rates between study-specific control performance and the other reference population groups. Results: The patients and controls were aged 68.0 (SD 6.0) and 67.9 (SD 7.0) years, respectively. The association of breast cancer-control status with impairment did not differ based on reference group. Cognitive impairment based on published normative data yielded less agreement on impairment rates (kappa = 0.22-0.89) than study-specific age and education-stratified control performance (kappa = 0.62-1.00). Conclusion: The choice of reference populations did not affect conclusions about the association of cognition with breast cancer. However, while study-specific reference populations provided greater internal consistency in defining cognitive impairment, benchmarking against published normative data will enhance the ability to compare results across studies.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Breast,"Behavioral Research Program, Healthcare Delivery Research Program",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=29471454,0,0,1,0

In this review, we seek to outline the current state of knowledge on what characterizes a 'healthy' or 'normal' intestinal microbiome, what factors modify the intestinal microbiome in the healthy state and how the intestinal microbiome affects normal host physiology. RECENT FINDINGS: What constitutes a 'normal' or 'healthy' intestinal microbiome is an area of active research, but key characteristics may include diversity, richness and a microbial community's resilience and ability to resist change. A number of factors, including age, the host immune system, host genetics, diet and antibiotic use, appear to modify the intestinal microbiome in the normal state. New research shows that the microbiome likely plays a critical role in the healthy human immune system and metabolism. SUMMARY: It is clear that there is a complicated bidirectional relationship between the intestinal microbiota and host which is vital to health. An enhanced understanding of this relationship will be critical not only to maximize and maintain human health but also to shape our understanding of disease and to foster new therapeutic approaches.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26237547,0,0,0,0

The patient-oncologist therapeutic alliance may be a modifiable factor that can prevent or reduce negative caregiver outcomes. METHODS: Coping with Cancer (CwC) was a prospective, longitudinal, multisite cohort study of terminally ill cancer patients (life expectancy </=6 months) and their informal caregivers, who were followed into bereavement (n = 68). Trained raters interviewed patients and caregivers upon study entry and also interviewed caregivers 6 months after the patient's death. Patients answered quantitative questions assessing their perception of the patient-oncologist therapeutic alliance (The Human Connection scale), and caregivers completed a measure of health-related quality of life (Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36). Interviewers rated caregivers' level of emotional well being. Associations between therapeutic alliance and caregiver outcomes were analyzed using univariate analysis of variance and logistic regression analyses, controlling for baseline caregiver measures and confounding sample characteristics. RESULTS: A strong patient-oncologist therapeutic alliance was bivariately associated with caregiver self-report of less role limitation because of emotional problems, better social function and mental and general health-related quality of life, and better interviewer-rated emotional well being after the patient's death. After controlling for baseline measures and confounding sample characteristics, the correlation between patient-perceived therapeutic alliance and bereaved caregivers' mental health and interviewer ratings of bereaved caregivers' emotional well being remained significant. CONCLUSIONS: The influence of the patient-oncologist alliance may generalize beyond the patient to positively impact the caregiver. By developing a strong relationship with the patient, the oncologist may benefit the caregiver and the patient. This caregiver benefit may extend into bereavement.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26042653,1,0,1,1

METHODS: Patients were recruited preoperatively (time 0) and assessed at 6, 12, and 18 months postoperatively. Limb volume change (LVC) was measured by perometry. Lymphedema was categorized as none, mild (LVC 5-9.9%), or moderate/severe (LVC>/=10%). Symptoms were assessed with a validated lymphedema instrument. Longitudinal logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify risk factors associated with moderate/severe lymphedema. RESULTS: Among 205 breast cancer and 144 melanoma patients, the cumulative incidence of moderate/severe lymphedema at 18 months was 36.5% and 35.0%, respectively. However, in adjusted analyses, factors associated with moderate/severe lymphedema were breast cancer (OR 2.0, P = 0.03), body mass index >/= 30 kg/m(2) (OR 1.6, P = 0.04), greater number of lymph nodes removed (OR 1.05, P < 0.01), and longer interval since surgery (OR 2.33 at 18 months, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Lymphedema incidence increased over time in both cohorts. However, the adjusted risk of moderate/severe lymphedema was two-fold higher in breast cancer patients.

In this article, we will summarize the organization and scientific activity of the PROMIS network during its first 2 years. DESIGN: The network consists of 6 primary research sites (PRSs), a statistical coordinating center (SCC), and NIH research scientists. Governed by a steering committee, the network is organized into functional subcommittees and working groups. In the first year, we created an item library and activated 3 interacting protocols: Domain Mapping, Archival Data Analysis, and Qualitative Item Review (QIR). In the second year, we developed and initiated testing of item banks covering 5 broad domains of self-reported health. RESULTS: The domain mapping process is built on the World Health Organization (WHO) framework of physical, mental, and social health. From this framework, pain, fatigue, emotional distress, physical functioning, social role participation, and global health perceptions were selected for the first wave of testing. Item response theory (IRT)-based analysis of 11 large datasets supplemented and informed item-level qualitative review of nearly 7000 items from available PRO measures in the item library. Items were selected for rewriting or creation with further detailed review before the first round of testing in the general population and target patient populations. CONCLUSIONS: The NIH PROMIS network derived a consensus-based framework for self-reported health, systematically reviewed available instruments and datasets that address the initial PROMIS domains.

Semin Radiat Oncol 2015;25(4):281-291",2015,The prediction of radiotherapy toxicity using single nucleotide polymorphism-based models: a step toward prevention,"Radiotherapy is a mainstay of cancer treatment, used in either a curative or palliative manner to treat approximately 50% of patients with cancer. Normal tissue toxicity limits the doses used in standard radiation therapy protocols and impedes improvements in radiotherapy efficacy. Damage to surrounding normal tissues can produce reactions ranging from bothersome symptoms that negatively affect quality of life to severe life-threatening complications. Improved ways of predicting, before treatment, the risk for development of normal tissue toxicity may allow for more personalized treatment and reduce the incidence and severity of late effects. There is increasing recognition that the cause of normal tissue toxicity is multifactorial and includes genetic factors in addition to radiation dose and volume of exposure, underlying comorbidities, age, concomitant chemotherapy or hormonal therapy, and use of other medications. An understanding of the specific genetic risk factors for normal tissue response to radiation has the potential to enhance our ability to predict adverse outcomes at the treatment-planning stage. Therefore, the field of radiogenomics has focused upon the identification of genetic variants associated with normal tissue toxicity resulting from radiotherapy. Innovative analytic methods are being applied to the discovery of risk variants and development of integrative predictive models that build on traditional normal tissue complication probability models by incorporating genetic information. Results from initial studies provide promising evidence that genetic-based risk models could play an important role in the implementation of precision medicine for radiation oncology through enhancing the ability to predict normal tissue reactions and thereby improve cancer treatment.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26384276,0,0,0,0

However, these studies only report switching between brands. The current study estimated the rates of switching both within and between brand families and examining factors associated with brand and brand style switching. METHODS: Data for this analysis are from the International Tobacco Control 2006-2011 US adult smoker cohort survey waves 5-8 (N=3248). A switch between brands was defined as reporting two different cigarette brand names for two successive waves, while switching within brand was defined as reporting the same brand name, but a different brand style. Repeated measures regression was used to determine factors associated with both switch types. RESULTS: A total of 1475 participants reported at least two successive waves of data with complete information on brand name and style. Overall switching increased from 44.9% in 2007-2008 to 58.4% in 2010-2011. Switching between brand names increased from 16% to 29%, while switches within the same brand name to a different style ranged from 29% to 33%. Between-brand switching was associated with younger age, lower income, non-white racial group and use of a discount brand, whereas, within-brand switching was associated with younger age and the use of a premium brand cigarette. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly half of smokers in the USA switched their cigarette brand or brand style within a year.

METHODS: The authors collected data about barriers to and facilitators of high-quality cancer care and innovative solutions to improve quality from three sources: focus groups with patients, family members of cancer patients and providers; site visits to cancer care providers and organisations in three American communities; and expert interviews. RESULTS: The authors' respondents consistently described a similar list of problems facing the individual with a suspicion or diagnosis of cancer and his/her family: delays in and lack of coordination of care, patient information gaps and passivity, inadequate attention to emotional and social problems, and difficulty accessing services because of inadequate insurance, limited financial resources or rural residence. The fragmentation and uncertain accountability of cancer care contribute to these issues. Respondents recommended linking patients with a care navigator or manager, using computer technology to better inform and support patients and connect providers, and reforming provider reimbursement to encourage more patient-centred care. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer patients and their families have urgent needs for information and support especially early in their course. To meet these needs, early cancer care must be better organised, integrated, and patient centred.

The authors examined the relationship between bone mineral density (BMD; a marker of lifetime estrogen exposure) and breast density. METHODS: The authors conducted a cross-sectional analysis among 1800 postmenopausal women > or = 54 years. BMD data were taken from two population-based studies conducted in 1992-1993 (n = 1055) and in 1998-1999 (n = 753). The authors linked BMD data with breast density information collected as part of a mammography screening program. They used linear regression to evaluate the density relationship, adjusted for age, hormone therapy use, body mass index (BMI), and reproductive covariates. RESULTS: There was a small but significant negative association between BMD and breast density. The negative correlation between density measures was not explained by hormone therapy or age, and BMI was the only covariate that notably influenced the relationship. Stratification by BMI only revealed the negative correlation between bone and breast densities in women with normal BMI. There was no relationship in overweight or obese women. The same relationship was seen for all women who had never used hormone therapy, but it was not significant once stratified by BMI.

We previously observed the haptoglobin (Hp) Hp2-2 genotype is associated with a approximately 10-fold increased CHD risk among individuals with HbA1c >/=6.5%, and thus might be useful in identifying those at high risk of CHD who would benefit from maintaining HbA1c <6.5%. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to model whether HbA1c >/= 6.5% in the Hp2-2 genotype is associated with CHD in a prospective case-control study nested within the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS). METHODS: HbA1c concentration and Hp genotype were determined for 695 incident cases of CHD from 1994 to 2010 and matched control participants. Logistic regression models calculated relative risk (RR) and 95% CI, for the first and second halves of follow-up, adjusting for confounding variables.

The etiology of AD is heterogeneous with amyloid-beta plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, oxidative stress, and aberrant DNA methylation all implicated in the disease pathogenesis. DNA methylation is a well-established process for regulating gene expression and has been found to regulate a growing number of important genes involved in AD development and progression. Additionally, aberrations in one-carbon metabolism are a common finding in AD patients with individuals exhibiting low S-adenosylmethionine and high homocysteine levels as well as low folate and vitamin B. Oxidative stress is considered one of the earliest events in AD pathogenesis and is thought to contribute largely to neuronal cell death. Emerging evidence suggests an interaction exists between oxidative stress and DNA methylation; however, the mechanism(s) remain unclear. This review summarizes known and potential genes implicated in AD that are regulated by DNA methylation and oxidative stress. We also highlight the evidence for the role of oxidative damage contributing to DNA hypomethylation in AD patients through several mechanisms as well as implications for disease understanding and therapeutic development.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=21605062,0,0,0,0

DESIGN: National survey of physicians caring for cancer patients conducted by the Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance Consortium. PARTICIPANTS: 1694 PCPs; 1621 oncologists. MEASUREMENTS: Questionnaires mailed during 2005 and 2006 examined the participation of physicians in 12 aspects of care for cancer patients. MAIN RESULTS: Over 90% of PCPs fulfilled general medical care roles for patients with cancer such as managing comorbid conditions, chronic pain, or depression; establishing do-not-resuscitate status; and referring patients to hospice. Oncologists were less involved in these roles. Determining the treatment preferences of individual patients and deciding on the use of surgery were the only cancer care roles in which > or =50% of PCPs participated. Twenty-two percent of PCPs reported no direct involvement in cancer care roles while 19% reported heavy involvement.

Am J Drug Alcohol Abuse 2015;41(6):541-546",2015,The role of smokeless tobacco use in smoking persistence among male college students,"BACKGROUND: Significant changes in the tobacco industry have led to heightened concern about co-use of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco (SLT) products. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess whether male cigarette smokers who also used SLT products, in the first semester of their first year of college, were more or less likely than male cigarette smokers who did not use SLT products to still be smoking by the first semester of their senior year. METHODS: Using a longitudinal, observational study, we followed a cohort of undergraduate students from 11 four-year universities in North Carolina and Virginia through their college career. Mixed-effects logistic regression analysis was conducted to estimate the likelihood of being a current smoker fall of senior year for male students who used both cigarettes and SLT at baseline, compared to those who only smoked cigarettes, after adjustment for potential confounders (n = 274). RESULTS: At baseline, 67.2% of participants were smoking cigarettes only (no SLT use) and 32.8% were dual users (cigarettes and SLT). A total of 62% were still smoking at senior year. Dual users were 30% more likely to be current smokers senior year compared to cigarette only users, although this difference was not statistically significant. Having at least one friend who smoked cigarettes and heavier cigarette smoking at baseline were significantly related to senior year smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not support the argument that SLT use may help male college smokers discontinue their smoking habit. In fact, it may contribute to smoking persistence.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26375618,0,0,1,0

We plotted serum concentration against distance from the plant both with and without consideration of the direction of their homes from the site. The decrease in exposure with distance could be described by an exponential function which was dependent on direction and climatic parameters. By kriging we created maps depicting predicted isoconcentration contours for sex- and age-adjusted serum concentration of summation operatorPCBs for the same group of children, adults and mothers. The principle of our risk analysis was to relate serum concentration data, reflecting PCB body burden, using the critical concentrations established by the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES 2010) as thresholds below which the probability of effects on health is regarded as negligible.

Stem cell transplantation (SCT) offers a potential cure for BMF or leukaemia, but incurs substantial risks. Little is known about factors influencing SCT decision making. OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to explore factors influencing patients' with FA and family members' decision making about SCT. DESIGN: Using a mixed-methods exploratory design, we surveyed US and Canadian patients with FA and family members who were offered SCT. MAIN VARIABLES STUDIED: Closed-ended survey items measured respondents' beliefs about the necessity, risks and concerns regarding SCT; multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the association between these factors and the decision to undergo SCT. Open-ended survey items measured respondents' perceptions of factors important to the SCT decision; qualitative analysis was used to identify emergent themes. RESULTS: The decision to undergo SCT was significantly associated with greater perceived necessity (OR = 2.81, P = 0.004) and lower concern about harms of SCT (OR = 0.31, P = 0.03). Qualitative analysis revealed a perceived lack of choice among respondents regarding the use of SCT, which was related to physician influence and respondent concerns about patients' quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, study results emphasize the importance of the delicate interplay between provider recommendation of a medical procedure and patient/parental perceptions and decision making. Findings can help providers understand the need to acknowledge family members' perceptions of SCT decision making and offer a comprehensive discussion of the necessity, risks, benefits and potential outcomes.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=23621292,0,0,1,0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was an institutional review board-approved and HIPAA-compliant study. Screening mammograms obtained from 1996 to 2007 in women 40-80 years old in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium were examined. Inclusion criteria were a recommendation for immediate follow-up at screening, or subsequent imaging, and observed follow-up within 180 days of the recommendation. Recommendations for additional imaging (AI) and biopsy or surgical consultation (BSC) were analyzed separately.

RESULTS: Data were available on 214,897 AI recommendations from 118 facilities and 35,622 BSC recommendations from 101 facilities. The median time to subsequent follow-up care after recommendation was 14 days for AI and 16 days for BSC. Approximately 90% of AI follow-up and 81% of BSC follow-up occurred within 30 days.

METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional data from the Health in Common (HIC) study, an observational study to investigate social and physical determinants of cancer risk-related behaviors among residents of low-income housing in three cities in the Boston metropolitan area. In this study, three indicators of hardship were used: food hardship, financial hardship, and material hardship (food and financial hardship combined). Logistic regression models were used to obtain the odds of currently trying to quit among current smokers in the HIC (n = 170) across hardship types experienced, adjusting for sociodemographic and psychosocial factors. RESULTS: Fully adjusted models revealed no statistically significant association between trying to quit tobacco use and indicators of material hardship: food hardship and financial hardship present (OR 1.33 (0.42-4.2); food hardship and no financial hardship OR 3.83 (0.97-15.13); and financial hardship but no food hardship OR 0.5 (0.1-2.39). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that even in the presence of material hardship, low-income housing resident tobacco users are not more likely to quit tobacco use; therefore, cessation efforts focused on the financial benefits of quitting may be insufficient to motivate quit attempts among low-income smokers.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26376892,0,0,1,0

Physician practices and patient willingness for less frequent pap test screening intervals,"BACKGROUND: Recent guidelines recommend longer Pap test intervals. However, physicians and patients may not be adopting these recommendations. OBJECTIVES: Identify (1) physician and practice characteristics associated with recommending a less frequent interval, and (2) characteristics associated with women's willingness to adhere to a 3-year interval. RESEARCH DESIGN: We used 2 national surveys: (1) a 2006/2007 National Survey of Primary Care Physicians for physician cervical cancer screening practices (N = 1114), and (2) the 2005 Health Information Trends Survey for women's acceptance of longer Pap intervals (N = 2206). MEASURES AND METHODS: Physician recommendation regarding Pap intervals was measured using a clinical vignette involving a 35-year-old with no new sexual partners and 3 consecutive negative Pap tests; associations with independent variables were evaluated with logistic regression. In parallel models, we evaluated women's willingness to follow a 3-year Pap test interval. RESULTS: A minority of physicians (32%) have adopted-but more than half of women are willing to adopt-3-year Pap test intervals. In adjusted models, physician factors associated with less frequent screening were: serving a higher proportion of Medicaid patients, white, non-Hispanic race, fewer years since medical school graduation, and US Preventive Services Task Force being very influential in physician clinical practice. Women were more willing to follow a 3-year interval if they were older, but less willing if they had personal or family experiences with cancer or followed an annual Pap test schedule.

Costs, benefits, and harms of breast cancer screening by age, biology, and health status","CONTEXT: Optimal ages of breast cancer screening cessation remain uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate screening policies based on age and quartiles of life expectancy (LE). DESIGN AND POPULATION: We used a stochastic model with proxies of age-dependent biology to evaluate the incremental U.S. societal costs and benefits of biennial screening from age 50 until age 70, 79, or lifetime. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Discounted incremental costs per life years saved (LYS). RESULTS: Lifetime screening is expensive (151,434 dollars per LYS) if women have treatment and survival comparable to clinical trials (idealized); stopping at age 79 costs 82,063 dollars per LYS. This latter result corresponds to costs associated with an LE of 9.5 years at age 79, a value expected for 75% of 79-year-olds, about 50% of 80-year-olds, and 25% of 85-year-olds. Using actual treatment and survival patterns, screening benefits are greater, and lifetime screening of all women might be considered (114,905 dollars per LYS), especially for women in the top 25% of LE for their age (50,643 dollars per LYS, life expectancy of approximately 7 years at age 90). CONCLUSIONS: If all women receive idealized treatment, the benefits of mammography beyond age 79 are too low relative to their costs to justify continued screening.

Tob Control 2015;24",2015,"Toxic metal and nicotine content of cigarettes sold in China, 2009 and 2012","BACKGROUND: Metals of primary health concern can accumulate in the tobacco plant and contribute to smokers' exposures to carcinogens, a significant cause of the millions of smoking-related deaths in China each year. These exposures are due to the smoker's addiction to nicotine. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to explore toxic heavy metal and nicotine concentrations in the tobacco of Chinese cigarette brands purchased in 2009 and 2012, as well as its regional variation. METHODS: Cigarette packs for this study were purchased from seven Chinese cities in 2009 and 2012, and 91 pairs of cigarettes were matched based on UPC for comparison. Ten cigarette sticks were randomly selected from each pack and tested using polarised energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (XRF) for arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni) and lead (Pb) concentrations. Nicotine analysis was conducted following Coresta's Recommended Method N degrees 62. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS, encompassing descriptive statistics, correlations and generalised estimating equations to observe changes in brand varieties overtime. FINDINGS: On average, from 2009 to 2012, As, Cd, Cr and Pb concentrations have decreased in Chinese tobacco. Of the seven cities where the cigarette brands were purchased, only four cities showed significant differences of the selected metals from 2009 to 2012. However, there was no significant change in the tobacco nicotine content from 2009 to 2012. CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco in Chinese cigarettes purchased in seven geographically disbursed cities contains consistently high levels of metals, including carcinogens like Cd. One source may be the improper use of fertilisers. These numbers should be monitored more carefully and regulated by health officials.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=25335903,0,0,0,0

Subst Abus 2015;36(4):470-477",2015,Trajectories of marijuana use beginning in adolescence predict tobacco dependence in adulthood,"BACKGROUND: Although the ""stage theory"" suggests that marijuana use occurs after the initiation of tobacco smoking, substantial evidence exists that they often occur concurrently, and that the use of marijuana may influence the use of tobacco. METHODS: This study uses trajectory analysis to examine the relationship between marijuana use beginning in adolescence and adult tobacco dependence in a 5-wave longitudinal study (mean ages in each wave: 14, 19, 24, 29, and 32). The sample consisted of 816 participants (52% African Americans, 48% Puerto Ricans), of whom 60% were females. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to predict later tobacco dependence from earlier trajectories of marijuana use. RESULTS: A higher Bayesian posterior probability (BPP) for the chronic marijuana use trajectory group (odds ratio [OR]=10.93, P<.001; adjusted OR [AOR]=10.40, P<.001), for the increasing marijuana use trajectory group (OR=6.94, P<.001; AOR=6.73, P<.001), and for the moderate marijuana use trajectory group (OR=3.13, P<.001; AOR=3.18, P<.001) was associated with an increased likelihood of being dependent on tobacco compared with the BPP of the no or low marijuana use trajectory group.

For men with seminoma and nonseminoma germ cell tumors (NSGCT), the percent receiving chemotherapy increased markedly as stage increased. More than 90% of men with regional and distant NSGCT received chemotherapy. Less than 25% of men with localized NSGCT received orchiectomy and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND), about 40% had surveillance following an orchiectomy alone, and 30% received orchiectomy and chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of these patients received therapy consistent with guidelines. While there was no significant difference in the use of RPLND in men with localized NSGCT by geographic region, chemotherapy use varied widely.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data on height and weight were collected between March 1995 and December 1996 as a part of nutrition survey to develop a food frequency questionnaire. Gender-stratified multiple logistic regression analyses were used to examine factors related to the current prevalence of overweight and obesity. RESULTS: Three hundred nine African American public housing residents and 293 African American hospital employees participated in this survey. Overall, hospital workers and public housing residents differed significantly in the distribution of BMI (p = 0.003). Among men, the prevalence of overweight and obesity were 34.9% and 29.4% for hospital workers and 27.0% and 18.2% for public housing residents, respectively. For females these rates were 31.3% and 46.3% for hospital employees and 26.1% and 42.9% for public housing residents, respectively.

METHODS: Data were derived from all available survey waves of the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Europe Surveys (2003-2013). France conducted three survey waves (n=1420-1735), Germany three waves (n=515-1515), The Netherlands seven waves (n=1420-1668), Ireland three waves (n=582-1071), Scotland two waves (n=461-507), and the rest of the United Kingdom conducted seven survey waves (n=861-1737). Smokers were asked whether four different policies (cigarette price, smoking restrictions in public places, free or lower cost medication, and warning labels on cigarette packs) influenced them to think about quitting. Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) models were estimated for each country. RESULTS: Cigarette price was mentioned most often in all countries and across all waves as trigger for thinking about quitting. Mentioning cigarette price and warning labels increased after the implementation of price increases and warning labels in some countries, while mentioning smoking restrictions decreased after their implementation in four countries. All studied policy triggers were mentioned more often by smokers with low and/or moderate education and income than smokers with high education and income. The education and income differences did not change significantly over time for most policies and in most countries. CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco control policies work as a trigger to increase thoughts about quitting, particularly in smokers with low education and low income and therefore have the potential to reduce health inequalities in smoking.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26282108,0,0,0,0

Previous research has often focused on disparities between particular groups, but few studies have summarized disparities across multiple subgroups defined by race-ethnic and socioeconomic position. METHODS: Data on breast cancer incidence, stage, mortality, and 5-year cause-specific probability of death (100 - survival) were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program and data on mammography screening from the National Health Interview Survey from 1987 to 2005. We used four area-socioeconomic groups based on the percentage of poverty in the county of residence (<10, 10-15, 15-20, +20%) and five race-ethnic groups (White, Black, Asian, American Indian, and Hispanic). We used summary measures of disparity based on both rate differences and rate ratios. RESULTS: From 1987 to 2004, area-socioeconomic disparities declined by 20% to 30% for incidence, stage at diagnosis, and 5-year cause-specific probability of death, and by roughly 100% for mortality, whether measured on the absolute or relative scale. In contrast, relative area-socioeconomic disparities in mammography use increased by 161%. Absolute race-ethnic disparities declined across all outcomes, with the largest reduction for mammography (56% decline). Relative race-ethnic disparities for mortality and 5-year cause-specific probability of death increased by 24% and 17%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests progress towards race-ethnic and area-socioeconomic disparity goals for breast cancer, especially when measured on the absolute scale. However, greater progress is needed to address increasing relative socioeconomic disparities in mammography and race-ethnic disparities in mortality and 5-year cause-specific probability of death.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Breast,"Health Services and Economics Branch, Office of the Associate Director, Surveillance Research Program, Applied Research Program",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=19124489,0,0,1,0

They have been introduced in jurisdictions with divergent existing laws that affect their legality. This provides the opportunity for natural experiments to assess effects of such laws in some cases independent of any formulated government policy. We compare patterns of EC awareness and use over a 3 year period in Australia where laws severely restrict EC availability, with awareness and use in the United Kingdom where ECs are readily available. METHODS: Data analyzed come from Waves 8 and 9 (collected in 2010 and 2013, respectively) of the International Tobacco Control surveys in Australia and the United Kingdom (approximately 1,500 respondents per wave per country). RESULTS: Across both waves, EC awareness, trial, and use among current and former smokers were significantly greater in the United Kingdom than in Australia, but all 3 of these measures increased significantly between 2010 and 2013 in both countries, and the rate of increase was equivalent between countries. Seventy-three percent of U.K. respondents reported that their current brands contained nicotine as did 43% in Australia even though sale, possession and/or use of nicotine-containing ECs without a permit are illegal in Australia. EC use was greater among smokers in both countries, at least in part due to less uptake by ex-smokers. CONCLUSIONS: EC awareness and use have risen rapidly between 2010 and 2013 among current and former smokers in both Australia and the United Kingdom despite different EC regulatory environments. Substantial numbers in both countries are using ECs that contain nicotine.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=25358657,0,0,1,0

White patients, aged 20 years or older with invasive cutaneous melanoma, were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End-Results population-based registries. Hospital and pathology records were reabstracted and physicians were asked to verify the provided therapy. The percentage of patients receiving lymph node biopsies increased over time. Sentinel lymph node biopsy increased between 1995 and 2001 from 5 to 32% for men and from 9 to 35% for women. The use of chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and immunotherapy changed little. Facilities with approved residency training programs were more likely to perform lymph node dissections, to perform sentinel lymph node biopsy, and to treat patients more aggressively than were facilities without such programs. Men were significantly more likely than women to die of cutaneous melanoma. In multivariable survival analysis, after adjusting for age, Charlson score, and surgical margins, survival did not change significantly over this time. Deaths were associated with increasing tumor thickness for men and women. Surgical treatment of local or regional melanoma became more extensive over time with fewer local excisions and more lymph node dissections, but with little change in adjuvant therapy. Survival was associated with tumor thickness. Early detection when the tumor thickness is less may decrease mortality.

Med Care 2007;45(2):154-159",2007,Trends in treatment costs for localized prostate cancer: the healthy screenee effect,"OBJECTIVE: We sought to obtain estimates of trends in initial treatment costs during the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) era that account for the changing patient case-mix associated with screening. SUBJECTS: We used reimbursement claims for Medicare-eligible subjects diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer between 1991 and 1999. Patients were grouped by initial treatment, with 17,846 receiving radical prostatectomy (RP), 25,933 receiving external beam radiotherapy (XRT), and 4525 receiving brachytherapy (BT). METHODS: Cancer-attributable costs were computed by subtracting noncancer costs from total Medicare reimbursements among newly diagnosed cancer patients. Noncancer costs were estimated in 2 ways: (1) average costs among age-matched, cancer-free control subjects (control method) and (2) projections based on claims from subjects before diagnosis (prediagnosis method). Adjusted annual percent change in cancer-attributable costs was calculated using multivariate generalized linear models. RESULTS: Noncancer costs increased at a much lower rate among men prior to diagnosis (3.8% annually) than among the general Medicare population (10.9%). The 2 approaches yielded different results; RP costs declined by 2.4% annually (prediagnosis method) versus 6.2% (control method); XRT costs declined by 1.5% versus 5.8%; and BT costs declined by 4.1% versus 8.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Because of self-selection of PSA screening, men diagnosed with prostate cancer today are now healthier overall than men in the general population and are considerably healthier than men diagnosed previously. Estimates of cancer-attributable costs that do not account for this healthy selection effect are likely to be biased. Declines in cancer-attributable treatment costs are evident even after accounting for a healthy screenee effect, suggesting that there has been a real reduction in cancer treatment costs.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Prostate, Male Genital Organs","Health Services and Economics Branch, Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Progra, Surveillance Research Program, Applied Research Program",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=17224778,0,0,1,0

We used two major U.S. surveys to investigate use of cigarillos and cigarettes. METHODS: The 2010/2011 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey ascertained cigar use by brand and type (little cigars/cigarillos or large/regular). The annual National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) assessed cigar use by brand, 2002-2011. We used the available data to classify cigars by type among males in the NSDUH. RESULTS: Estimated prevalence of little cigar use among male cigar smokers was similar using the two surveys. From 2002 to 2011, past-30-day cigarette smoking declined for all age groups and genders, but among young adult men (aged 18-25) little cigar smoking remained steady at nearly 9%. ""Cigarette and/or cigar"" smoking was 44% among young adult men in 2011, and was consistently 6 percentage points higher than cigarette-only smoking, from 2002 to 2011. Over 60% of male and 70% of female adolescent/young adult cigar smokers also smoked cigarettes in 2011. Most male adolescents preferred little cigars to traditional cigars. Among males, most lower income or less educated cigar smokers preferred little cigars, compared to only 16% of those with higher education. CONCLUSIONS: These patterns indicate that little cigar/cigarillo use may promote initiation and maintenance of cigarette smoking, particularly among younger and less advantaged populations. Population-level data are urgently needed to better assess type of cigar smoked and reasons for use.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=25239955,0,0,1,0

We used an established scoring system in a population-based cohort to determine a histologic cutoff for ""high"" tumor budding and confirm its prognostic significance. We retrieved hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections from 553 incident colorectal carcinoma cases. Each case was previously characterized for select molecular alterations and survival data. Interobserver agreement was assessed between 2 gastrointestinal pathologists and a group of 4 general surgical pathologists. High budding (>/= 10 tumor buds in a x20 objective field) was present in 32% of cases, low budding in 46%, and no budding in 22%. High tumor budding was associated with advanced pathologic stage (P < 0.001), microsatellite stability (P = 0.005), KRAS mutation (P = 0.010), and on multivariate analysis with a > 2 times risk of cancer-specific death (hazard ratio = 2.57 [1.27, 5.19]). After multivariate adjustment, by penalized smoothing splines, we found increasing tumor bud counts from 5 upward to be associated with an increasingly shortened cancer-specific survival. By this method, a tumor bud count of 10 corresponded to approximately 2.5 times risk of cancer-specific death. The interobserver agreement was good with weighted kappa of 0.70 for 2 gastrointestinal pathologists over 121 random cases and 0.72 between all 6 pathologists for 20 random cases. Using an established method to assess budding on routine histologic stains, we have shown that a cutoff of 10 for high tumor budding is independently associated with a significantly worse prognosis.

Nevertheless, lung cancer screening tests are available in the U.S., and primary care physicians (PCPs) may have a role in recommending them to patients. PURPOSE: This study describes U.S. PCPs' beliefs about and recommendations for lung cancer screening and examines characteristics of PCPs who recommend screening. METHODS: A nationally representative survey of practicing PCPs was conducted in 2006-2007. Mailed questionnaires were used to assess PCPs' beliefs about lung cancer screening guidelines and the effectiveness of screening tests and to determine whether PCPs would recommend screening for asymptomatic patients. Data were analyzed in 2009. RESULTS: Nine hundred sixty-two PCPs completed the survey (absolute response rate=70.6%; cooperation rate=76.8%). One quarter said that major guidelines support lung cancer screening. Two thirds said that low-radiation dose spiral computed tomography (LDCT) screening is very or somewhat effective in reducing lung cancer mortality in current smokers; LDCT was perceived as more effective than chest x-ray or sputum cytology. Responding to vignettes describing asymptomatic patients of varying smoking exposure, 67% of PCPs recommended lung cancer screening for at least one of the vignettes. Most PCPs recommending screening said they would use chest x-ray; up to 26% would use LDCT.

The keystone to this effort is the baseline patient survey administered approximately 4 months after diagnosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We developed a survey to obtain information from patients newly diagnosed with lung and colorectal cancer about their personal characteristics, decision making, experience of care, and outcomes. We conducted a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of a lengthy and clinically detailed interview in a convenience sample of patients within 8 months of diagnosis (n=71). MAIN RESULTS: The median length of the interviews was 75 min for patients with lung cancer (range 43-130) and 82 min for patients with colorectal cancer (range 46-119). Most patients had received some form of treatment for their cancer: 66.1% had undergone surgery, 28.2% had received radiation therapy, and 54.9% were treated with chemotherapy.

Cancer 2008;112(4):934-942",2008,Understanding high-quality cancer care: a summary of expert perspectives,"BACKGROUND: The Institute of Medicine (IOM) report Crossing the Quality Chasm proposed 6 aims for high-quality healthcare: effective, safe, timely, efficient, equitable, and patient-centered, and emphasized care coordination. Through interviews with nationally recognized experts in healthcare quality, perspectives on barriers and facilitators to achieving these aims for cancer patients were elicited. METHODS: In all, 23 peer-nominated experts with diverse backgrounds in policy, healthcare, patient advocacy, and research were individually interviewed. They were asked about barriers and facilitators to achieving high-quality cancer care, and information technology or other innovations that might improve the quality of cancer diagnosis, treatment, and surveillance. Interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed. Two analysts independently reviewed and coded each transcript using ethnographic software to elucidate key themes. RESULTS: The major perceived barrier to providing high-quality cancer care was unnecessary variation in cancer care because of lack of standardization or adherence to guidelines during diagnosis, treatment, and surveillance. Additional barriers included insufficient teamwork and communication among multidisciplinary care teams, lack of patient awareness and empowerment, diagnostic delays during provider transitions, and excessive reimbursement for treatment. Experts suggested improving cancer patients' experiences by standardizing care, adhering to guidelines, and using 'patient navigators' and an interoperable electronic medical record accessible to patients and providers at multiple facilities. CONCLUSIONS: Some of these solutions have been developed and tested, whereas others have not. It is hoped that these suggestions provide impetus for new research, accelerating progress toward achieving the IOM's vision for high-quality cancer care. Cancer 2008.

The role of unmetabolized folic acid (UFA) from high folic acid consumption in carcinogenesis is largely unexplored. We evaluated prediagnostic plasma levels of UFA in relation to CRC risk in nested case-control studies (618 CRC case patients and 1207 matched control) with blood samples collected prior to folic acid fortification. UFA was detected in 21.4% of control UFA levels were not associated with CRC risk. Compared with undetectable levels, the multivariable relative risks (RRs) of CRC were 1.03 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.73 to 1.46) for less than 0.5 nmol/L and 1.12 (95% CI = 0.81 to 1.55) for 0.5 nmol/L or more (Ptrend = .32). A positive association between UFA levels and CRC risk was observed among men (RR = 1.57, 95% CI = 0.99 to 2.49 for >/=0.5 nmol/L vs undetectable, Pinteraction = .04), and a positive association was also observed among those with the methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) CT/TT genotype (RR = 2.20, 95% CI = 1.22 to 3.94 for >/=0.5 nmol/L vs undetectable, Pinteraction=0.02).

Rehabil Psychol 2013;58(4):342-349",2013,Upper extremity lymphedema: presence and effect on functioning five years after breast cancer treatment,"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to explore the effects of lymphedema on long-term adjustment among breast cancer survivors, in terms of functioning in important life environments. RESEARCH METHOD/DESIGN: Limb volume measurements and psychosocial survey data were collected from women shortly after undergoing surgical intervention for breast cancer and annually thereafter. A subset of these women were selected for the current study because they had preoperative limb volume measurement data, which is best suited to determine presence and severity of lymphedema. Our final sample of 61 women had both the arm measurements (preoperative and 5-year) and survey data (baseline and 5-year) needed for this study, which comprises a secondary cross-sectional analysis of longitudinal data. A correlational approach was used to explore associations among lymphedema (presence, severity, and whether the participant met the criteria for lymphedema at any assessment point since their treatment for breast cancer) and outcome variables (physical functioning, vocational functioning, social functioning, domestic functioning, and sexual functioning). RESULTS: Each of the three measures of lymphedema was significantly correlated with domestic functioning, but not with functioning in other common environments. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: Long-term breast cancer survivors are at risk for developing secondary conditions, such as lymphedema, to which they must learn to adjust and adapt. Lymphedema may increase risk for compromised functioning in everyday environments, a problem which lies at the heart of rehabilitation. Breast cancer survivorship, therefore, fits well within the scope of a rehabilitation framework.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Breast,Office of Cancer Survivorship,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=24295526,0,1,1,0

Cancer Causes Control 2015;26(10):1501-1506",2015,Urinary melatonin and risk of ovarian cancer,"PURPOSE: Melatonin has anti-carcinogenic properties, including modulation of estradiol production, cell cycle regulation, and promotion of apoptosis. Urinary melatonin has been inversely associated with breast cancer in some studies, but the association with ovarian cancer has not been investigated. METHODS: We measured urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT6s) in nested ovarian cancer case-control studies in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS; n = 100 cases; 199 controls) and NHSII (n = 52 cases; 105 controls); samples were mainly from first morning voids. Controls were matched to cases on year of birth, menopause status, use of menopausal hormone therapy, and urine collection characteristics. We evaluated the association of tertiles of aMT6s, corrected for creatinine concentrations, with risk of ovarian cancer using conditional logistic regression. Models were adjusted for key ovarian cancer risk factors, and we additionally evaluated adjustment for usual sleep duration, snoring, and history of rotating night shift work. RESULTS: aMT6s was not significantly associated with risk of ovarian cancer. In multivariable models, the odds ratio comparing the highest tertile of aMT6s to the lowest was 0.79, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.40-1.56 in the NHS and 2.88, and 95 % CI in the NHSII 0.97-8.52. Additional adjustment for sleep habits and night shift work had little impact on the observed results. We observed no clear association between urinary melatonin and ovarian cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with our previous study in which we reported no association between night shift work and ovarian cancer; however, given the small sample size in our study, additional evaluation in larger studies is warranted.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher","Ovary, Female Genital Organs",Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26223889,0,1,1,0

We assessed associations between adult traditional tobacco product use and absolute harm perceptions of traditional and alternative tobacco products. We also described the topics individuals looked for during their last search for information, their beliefs about chemicals in cigarettes/cigarette smoke, and how both relate to harm perceptions. METHODS: We ran multivariable models with jackknife replicate weights to analyze data from the 2015 administration of the National Cancer Institute's Health Information National Trends Survey (N=3376). RESULTS: Compared to never users, individuals reported lower perceived levels of harm for products they use. Among current tobacco users, ethnicity, thinking about chemicals in tobacco, and information-seeking were all factors associated with tobacco product harm perceptions. In the full sample, some respondents reported searching for information about health effects and cessation and held misperceptions about the source of chemicals in tobacco. CONCLUSIONS: This study fills a gap in the literature by assessing the absolute harm perceptions of a variety of traditional and alternative tobacco products. Harm perceptions vary among tobacco products, and the relationship among tobacco use, information seeking, thoughts about chemicals in tobacco products, and harm perceptions is complex. Data suggest that some individuals search for information about health effects and cessation and hold misperceptions about chemicals in tobacco products. Future inquiry could seek to understand the mechanisms that contribute to forming harm perceptions and beliefs about chemicals in tobacco products.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=28259026,1,0,1,0

However, to the authors' knowledge little is known regarding the prevalence and predictors of participation in health-related support groups. METHODS: A total of 9187 participants in the California Health Interview Survey Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CHIS-CAM) study completed a telephone interview in 2003 (1844 participants with cancer and 4951 participants with other chronic health problems). Participants were asked to describe previous/ current support group use, benefits of support group use, and physician involvement in decisions regarding support groups. Weighted logistic regression analyses were conducted using SUDAAN software to examine patterns of support group use. RESULTS: The prevalence of support group use was found to be higher among cancer survivors (23.7%) than those with another chronic health condition (14.5%). Predictors of support group use were found to be similar across groups and included female gender, greater education, use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), depression, and anxiety. Age, health insurance, and presence of depression predicted support group use differently for cancer survivors and those with other conditions. The percentages of those perceiving support groups to be beneficial varied from 35.1% for those with skin cancer to 96% for those with cervical cancer. The percentage of participants reporting that their physician recommended a support group was low (10.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Health-related support groups are used by nearly 1 in 4 cancer survivors, but levels of utilization differ across subgroups.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the best method for measuring cancer-related surgery among patients in the SEER-Medicare database. SUBJECTS: A total of 149,970 incident cases of breast, colorectal, endometrial, lung, pancreatic, and prostate cancer diagnosed between 1991 and 1993.MEASURES The most invasive surgical procedure identified through Medicare's inpatient, physician, and hospital outpatient claims was compared with corresponding data from the SEER files. RESULTS: Agreement between the SEER and Medicare files was generally highest for resection and radical surgery (eg, kappa 0.70-0.90). While there was less agreement regarding no surgical therapy and biopsy individually, the concordance of the two sources in excluding cancer-directed surgery was high. Compared with inpatient data alone, using the combined inpatient, physician, and outpatient data increased concordance between SEER and Medicare for less invasive procedures. CONCLUSIONS: The agreement of SEER and Medicare data appears to be good for major surgical procedures and for excluding persons who did not undergo cancer-directed surgery. Both the SEER and the Medicare data captured a small number of surgeries not reported in the other file. Therefore, where possible, using both data sources will enhance identification of surgeries.

The association of assessments and recommendations and the relationship of self-reported symptoms to assessments are described. RESULTS: A total of 51,673 diagnostic mammograms were included in the analyses and the expected management recommendation was provided 85%-90% of the time for mammograms classified as assessment categories 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Understanding how such tools affect key social-cognitive precursors of behavior change is crucial for leveraging their potential into effective interventions. PURPOSE: To test the effects of a publicly available, Internet-based, breast cancer risk assessment tool on social-cognitive precursors of physical activity. METHODS: Women (N = 132) aged 40-78 with no personal cancer history indicated their perceived risk of breast cancer and were randomly assigned to receive personalized ( www.yourdiseaserisk.wustl.edu ) or nonpersonalized breast cancer risk information. Immediately thereafter, breast cancer risk perceptions and physical activity-related behavioral intentions, self-efficacy, and response efficacy were assessed. RESULTS: Personalized information elicited higher intentions, self-efficacy, and response efficacy than nonpersonalized information, P values < 0.05. Self-efficacy and response efficacy mediated the effect of personalizing information on intentions. Women who received personalized information corrected their inaccurate risk perceptions to some extent, P values < 0.05, but few fully accepted the information.

METHODS: In March 2014, a comprehensive review was undertaken to identify studies that collected accelerometry data in adults (sample size, n >/= 400). In addition, 20 physical activity experts were invited to participate in a two-phase Delphi process to obtain consensus on the following: unique research opportunities available with such data, additional data required to address these opportunities, strategies for enabling comparisons between studies/countries, requirements for implementing/progressing such strategies, and value of a global repository of accelerometry data. RESULTS: The review identified accelerometry data from more than 275,000 adults from 76 studies across 36 countries. Consensus was achieved after two rounds of the Delphi process; 18 experts participated in one or both rounds. The key opportunities highlighted were the ability for cross-country/cross-population comparisons and the analytic options available with the larger heterogeneity and greater statistical power. Basic sociodemographic and anthropometric data were considered a prerequisite for this. Disclosure of monitor specifications and protocols for data collection and processing were deemed essential to enable comparison and data harmonization. There was strong consensus that standardization of data collection, processing, and analytical procedures was needed. To implement these strategies, communication and consensus among researchers, development of an online infrastructure, and methodological comparison work were required. There was consensus that a global accelerometry data repository would be beneficial and worthwhile.

Because models often require assumptions about unobservable processes, assessing a model's predictive accuracy is important. METHODS: We validated 3 colorectal cancer (CRC) microsimulation models against outcomes from the United Kingdom Flexible Sigmoidoscopy Screening (UKFSS) Trial, a randomized controlled trial that examined the effectiveness of one-time flexible sigmoidoscopy screening to reduce CRC mortality. The models incorporate different assumptions about the time from adenoma initiation to development of preclinical and symptomatic CRC. Analyses compare model predictions to study estimates across a range of outcomes to provide insight into the accuracy of model assumptions. RESULTS: All 3 models accurately predicted the relative reduction in CRC mortality 10 years after screening (predicted hazard ratios, with 95% percentile intervals: 0.56 [0.44, 0.71], 0.63 [0.51, 0.75], 0.68 [0.53, 0.83]; estimated with 95% confidence interval: 0.56 [0.45, 0.69]). Two models with longer average preclinical duration accurately predicted the relative reduction in 10-year CRC incidence. Two models with longer mean sojourn time accurately predicted the number of screen-detected cancers. All 3 models predicted too many proximal adenomas among patients referred to colonoscopy. CONCLUSION: Model accuracy can only be established through external validation. Analyses such as these are therefore essential for any decision model. Results supported the assumptions that the average time from adenoma initiation to development of preclinical cancer is long (up to 25 years), and mean sojourn time is close to 4 years, suggesting the window for early detection and intervention by screening is relatively long. Variation in dwell time remains uncertain and could have important clinical and policy implications.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Colorectal,"Healthcare Delivery Research Program, Surveillance Research Program",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26746432,0,1,0,0

METHODS: Facilities performing diagnostic mammography within three registries of the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium were surveyed about their structure, organization, and interpretive processes. Performance measurements (false-positive rate, sensitivity, and likelihood of cancer among women referred for biopsy [positive predictive value of biopsy recommendation {PPV2}]) from January 1, 1998, through December 31, 2005, were prospectively measured. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses, adjusted for patient and radiologist characteristics, were used to assess the association between facility characteristics and interpretive performance. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Forty-five of the 53 facilities completed a facility survey (85% response rate), and 32 of the 45 facilities performed diagnostic mammography. The analyses included 28 100 diagnostic mammograms performed as an evaluation of a breast problem, and data were available for 118 radiologists who interpreted diagnostic mammograms at the facilities. Performance measurements demonstrated statistically significant interpretive variability among facilities (sensitivity, P = .006; false-positive rate, P < .001; and PPV2, P < .001) in unadjusted analyses. However, after adjustment for patient and radiologist characteristics, only false-positive rate variation remained statistically significant and facility traits associated with performance measures changed (false-positive rate = 6.5%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.5% to 7.4%; sensitivity = 73.5%, 95% CI = 67.1% to 79.9%; and PPV2 = 33.8%, 95% CI = 29.1% to 38.5%). Facilities reporting that concern about malpractice had moderately or greatly increased diagnostic examination recommendations at the facility had a higher false-positive rate (odds ratio [OR] = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.09 to 2.01) and a non-statistically significantly higher sensitivity (OR = 1.74, 95% CI = 0.94 to 3.23). Facilities offering specialized interventional services had a non-statistically significantly higher false-positive rate (OR = 1.97, 95% CI = 0.94 to 4.1). No characteristics were associated with overall accuracy by ROC curve analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Variation in diagnostic mammography interpretation exists across facilities.

Eur J Cancer 2014;50(1):185-192",2014,Variation in detection of ductal carcinoma in situ during screening mammography: a survey within the International Cancer Screening Network,"BACKGROUND: There is concern about detection of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in screening mammography. DCIS accounts for a substantial proportion of screen-detected lesions but its effect on breast cancer mortality is debated. The International Cancer Screening Network conducted a comparative analysis to determine variation in DCIS detection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were collected during 2004-2008 on number of screening examinations, detected breast cancers, DCIS cases and Globocan 2008 breast cancer incidence rates derived from national or regional cancer registers. We calculated screen-detection rates for breast cancers and DCIS. RESULTS: Data were obtained from 15 screening settings in 12 countries; 7,176,050 screening examinations; 29,605 breast cancers and 5324 DCIS cases. The ratio between highest and lowest breast cancer incidence was 2.88 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.76-3.00); 2.97 (95% CI 2.51-3.51) for detection of breast cancer; and 3.49 (95% CI 2.70-4.51) for detection of DCIS. CONCLUSIONS: Considerable international variation was found in DCIS detection. This variation could not be fully explained by variation in incidence nor in breast cancer detection rates. It suggests the potential for wide discrepancies in management of DCIS resulting in overtreatment of indolent DCIS or undertreatment of potentially curable disease. Comprehensive cancer registration is needed to monitor DCIS detection.

Ann Epidemiol 2001;11(4):257-263",2001,Variation in mammographic breast density by race,"PURPOSE: Because of the observed racial differences in risk of developing breast cancer, the authors conducted a study to determine the variation in breast density, a strong predictor of breast cancer risk, by race and age. METHODS: Study subjects were women enrolled in Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound, Seattle, WA, aged 20-79 years, who had a screening mammogram between 6/1/96 and 8/1/97. Women with increased breast density (BI-RADS 'heterogeneously dense' and 'extremely dense') (n = 14,178) were compared to those with fatty breasts (BI-RADS 'almost entirely fat' and 'scattered fibroglandular tissue') (n = 14,323). Logistic regression was used with adjustment for age, parity, age at first birth, menopausal status, current use of hormone replacement therapy, and body mass index. RESULTS: The odds ratio (OR) for having dense breasts versus fatty breasts, comparing Asian to White women, increased from 1.2 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.9-1.6] for women age <45 to 1.6 (95% CI 1.3-2.2) for women over 65. Conversely, the OR for Black compared to White women was highest for the women age 65 and younger (OR 1.7 (1.2-2.3), 1.3(1.0-1.7), and 1.7 (1.2-2.3) for women age <45, 46-55, and 56-65, respectively), whereas Black women over 65 had similar density as Whites.

J Natl Cancer Inst 1998;90(12):906-910",1998,Variation in mammographic breast density by time in menstrual cycle among women aged 40-49 years,"BACKGROUND: Mammography is less effective for women aged 40-49 years than for older women, which has led to a call for research to improve the performance of screening mammography for younger women. One factor that may influence the performance of mammography is breast density. Younger women have greater mammographic breast density on average, and increased breast density increases the likelihood of false-negative and false-positive mammograms. We investigated whether breast density varies according to time in a woman's menstrual cycle. METHODS: Premenopausal women aged 40-49 years who were not on exogenous hormones and who had a screening mammogram at a large health maintenance organization during 1996 were studied (n = 2591). Time in the menstrual cycle was based on the woman's self-reported last menstrual bleeding and usual cycle length. RESULTS: A smaller proportion of women had 'extremely dense' breasts during the follicular phase of their menstrual cycle (24% for week 1 and 23% for week 2) than during the luteal phase (28% for both weeks 3 and 4) (two-sided P = .04 for the difference in breast density between the phases, adjusted for body mass index). The relationship was stronger for women whose body mass index was less than or equal to the median (two-sided P<.01), the group who have the greatest breast density. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: These findings are consistent with previous evidence suggesting that scheduling a woman's mammogram during the follicular phase (first and second week) of her menstrual cycle instead of during the luteal phase (third and fourth week) may improve the accuracy of mammography for premenopausal women in their forties.

Ann Surg Oncol 2010;17(6):1581-1588",2010,Variations in surgeon treatment recommendations for lobectomy in early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer by patient age and comorbidity,"BACKGROUND: Prior research suggests that older patients are less likely to undergo resection of early-stage non-small-cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs). We surveyed surgeons to understand how their recommendations for lobectomy were influenced by age, the presence and severity of smoking-related lung disease, or by characteristics of the surgeons and their practices. METHODS: We surveyed surgeons caring for NSCLC patients regarding whether they would recommend lobectomy for hypothetical patients with early-stage NSCLC who varied by age (55 vs. 80 years) and comorbid illness (none, moderate, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]). Ordinal logistic regression was used to identify the importance of patient, surgeon, and practice characteristics on surgery recommendations. RESULTS: Surgeons recommended lobectomy for nearly all patients who were 55 years old with no comorbidity (adjusted proportion 98.6%), 55 years old with moderate COPD (adjusted proportion 97.8%), or 80 years old with no comorbidity (adjusted proportion 98.1%). Fewer recommended lobectomy for 80-year-old patients with moderate COPD (adjusted proportion 82.3%), and far fewer recommended lobectomy for severe COPD, irrespective of age (adjusted rate 18.7% for the 55-year-old patient and 6.1% for the 80-year-old patient) (P < 0.002). Surgeons who enroll patients onto clinical trials (P = 0.03) were more likely than others to recommend lobectomy, but no other surgeon characteristic predicted recommendations.

However, our understanding of this problem is limited, in part because of the absence of a unified, coherent concept of uncertainty. There are multiple meanings and varieties of uncertainty in health care that are not often distinguished or acknowledged although each may have unique effects or warrant different courses of action. The literature on uncertainty in health care is thus fragmented, and existing insights have been incompletely translated to clinical practice. This article addresses this problem by synthesizing diverse theoretical and empirical literature from the fields of communication, decision science, engineering, health services research, and psychology and developing a new integrative conceptual taxonomy of uncertainty. A 3-dimensional taxonomy is proposed that characterizes uncertainty in health care according to its fundamental sources, issues, and locus.

Visual inspection of accelerometer output may supplement missing logs; however, no data on the validity of this method are available. METHODS: We compared visual inspection with participant logs in 197 women (mean age, 71.0 yr). Women were mailed an accelerometer to be worn during waking hours for 7 d, marking each wear day on a log before returning the accelerometer by mail. For every participant, we created a series of graphs of accelerometer counts by time of day (one chart for each day with accelerometer output, including mail days). Two raters, masked to log wear status, independently inspected these graphs and scored each day as ""worn"" or ""not worn."" RESULTS: The median (interquartile range) number of valid wear days using either visual inspection or log was 7 (7-7). For rater 1, the sensitivity and specificity of visual inspection was 99.7% (95% confidence interval, 99.2%-99.9%) and 97.2% (95.2%-98.6%), respectively; for rater 2, the sensitivity and specificity of visual inspection was 99.7% (99.2%-99.9%) and 97.0% (94.9%-98.4%), respectively.

This issue is important because vitamin D influences pathways related to carcinogenesis. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this report was to describe and understand vitamin D status in a breast cancer survivor cohort. DESIGN: Data are from the Health, Eating, Activity, and Lifestyle study. With the use of a cross-sectional design, we examined serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] in 790 breast cancer survivors from western Washington state, New Mexico, and Los Angeles County. Cancer treatment data were obtained from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries and medical records. Fasting blood, anthropometry, and lifestyle habits were collected after diagnosis and treatment. We examined distributions of 25(OH)D by race-ethnicity, season, geography, and clinical characteristics. Multivariate regression tested associations between 25(OH)D and stage of disease. RESULTS: Five hundred ninety-seven (75.6%) of the women had low serum 25(OH)D, suggesting vitamin D insufficiency or frank deficiency. The overall mean (+/-SD) was 24.8 +/- 10.4 ng/mL, but it was lower for African Americans (18.1 +/- 8.7 ng/mL) and Hispanics (22.1 +/- 9.2 ng/mL). Women with localized (n = 424) or regional (n = 182) breast cancer had lower serum 25(OH)D than did women with in situ disease (n = 184) (P = 0.05 and P = 0.03, respectively). Multivariate regression models controlled for age, body mass index (in kg/m(2)), race-ethnicity, geography, season, physical activity, diet, and cancer treatments showed that stage of disease independently predicted serum 25(OH)D (P = 0.02).

An assessment of patient-clinician discordance in medical oncology encounters,"BACKGROUND: Shared decision making is promoted to improve cancer care quality. Patients and clinicians may have different ideas about what constitutes a cancer care decision, which may limit the validity of self-reported measures of shared decision making. We sought to estimate the extent to which patients and clinicians agree on whether a cancer care decision was made during an outpatient encounter. METHODS: We surveyed patients and clinicians immediately after an oncology encounter at a large, tertiary medical centre and calculated agreement in response to the single-item question, 'Was a specific decision about cancer care made during the appointment today?' Answer options were 'yes' and 'no'. Participants were 315 oncology patients, with any solid tumour malignancy and at any stage of management, and their clinicians (22 staff oncologists, nine senior fellows and five nurse practitioners). RESULTS: Patients and clinicians reported having made a cancer care decision in 184 (58%) and 174 (55%) of encounters, respectively. They agreed on whether a cancer care decision was made in 213 (68%) of encounters (chance-adjusted agreement was 0.34); in 56 of the 102 discordant encounters, the patient reported making a decision while the clinician did not. We found no significant correlates with discordance. CONCLUSIONS: Patients and clinicians do not always agree on whether a cancer care decision was made. As such, measures that ask patients and/or clinicians to evaluate a decision-making process or outcome may be methodologically insufficient when they do not explicitly orient respondents towards the thing they are being asked to assess.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=25619877,0,0,0,0

CONCLUSIONS: Recall of the campaign was associated with more attention to and talking about HWLs. When adjusting for campaign recall, there was still an increasing trend in attention and talking.

Participants were recruited on average 6 months (2-12 months) after diagnosis. Height, weight, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were assessed at approximately 30 months post-diagnosis; cancer-related symptoms (chest wall and arm symptoms, vasomotor symptoms, urinary incontinence, vaginal symptoms, cognition/mood problems, sleep, sexual interest/function), and HRQOL (SF-36) were assessed at approximately 40 months post-diagnosis. Weight was measured at baseline in a subset. Data on 661 participants were evaluable for body mass index (BMI); 483 were evaluable for weight change.

Philip Morris's changing corporate narrative,"OBJECTIVES: We sought to learn how employees reacted to changes in the corporate narrative of Philip Morris Companies (PMC) in the late 1990s and early 2000s. METHODS: We analyzed archival internal tobacco industry documents about PMC's creation of a new corporate story. RESULTS: In response to litigation and public opprobrium, PMC replaced its market success-oriented corporate narrative with a new one centered on responsibility. Although management sought to downplay inconsistencies between the old and new narratives, some employees reportedly had difficulty reconciling them, concerned that the responsibility focus might affect company profitability. However, others embraced the new narrative, suggesting radical ideas to prevent youth smoking. These ideas were not adopted. CONCLUSIONS: PMC's new narrative was unconvincing to many of its employees, who perceived it either as a threat to the company's continued profits or as incongruous with what they had previously been told. As it had done with the public, PMC misled its employees in explaining a narrative repositioning that would help the company continue business as usual. Moving toward a tobacco endgame will require ongoing discursive and symbolic efforts to disrupt this narrative.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=26270280,0,0,0,0

Topics include the importance of reliability and validity, psychometric approaches used to provide reliability and validity estimates, the kinds of evidence needed to indicate that a PRO has a sufficient level of reliability and validity, contexts that may affect psychometric properties, methods available to evaluate PRO instruments when the context varies, and types of reliability and validity testing that are appropriate during different phases of clinical trials. Points discussed include the perspective that the psychometric properties of reliability and validity are on a continuum in which the more evidence one has, the greater confidence there is in the value of the PRO data. Construct validity is the type of validity most frequently used with PRO instruments as few 'gold standards' exist to allow the use of criterion validity and content validity by itself only provides beginning evidence of validity. Several guidelines are recommended for establishing sufficient evidence of reliability and validity. For clinical trials, a minimum reliability threshold of 0.70 is recommended. Sample sizes for testing should include at least 200 cases and results should be replicated in at least one additional sample. At least one full report on the development of the instrument and one on the use of the instrument are deemed necessary to evaluate the PRO psychometric properties. Psychometric testing ideally occurs before the initiation of Phase III trials. When testing does not occur prior to a Phase III trial, considerable risk is posed in relation to the ability to substantiate the use of the PRO data. Various qualitative (e.g., focus groups, behavioral coding, cognitive interviews) and quantitative approaches (e.g., differential item functioning testing) are useful in evaluating the reliability and validity of PRO instruments","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,"Outcomes Research, Applied Research Program",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=17995479,0,0,0,0

SETTING AND PATIENTS: We analyzed the medical bills for the 6,308 Medicare patients > 65 years old with diagnosed stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the 11 SEER (survival, epidemiology, and end results) regions between 1991 and 1993. The main outcome measure, chemotherapy administration, was identified by the relevant medical billing codes. Patient sociodemographic and disease characteristics were obtained from the SEER database and census data. RESULTS: Almost 22% of patients received chemotherapy at some time for their metastatic NSCLC. As expected, younger patients and those with fewer comorbid conditions were more likely to receive chemotherapy. However, several nonmedical factors, such as nonblack race, higher socioeconomic status, treatment in a teaching hospital, and living in the Seattle/Puget Sound or Los Angeles SEER regions, also significantly increased a patient's likelihood of receiving chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Compared to previous reports, the prevalence of chemotherapy use for advanced NSCLC appears to be increasing. However, despite uniform health insurance coverage, there is wide variation in the utilization of palliative chemotherapy among Medicare patients, and nonmedical factors are strong predictors of whether a patient receives chemotherapy. While it is impossible to know the appropriate rate of usage, nonmedical factors should only influence a patient's likelihood of receiving treatment if they reflect patient treatment preference. Research to further clarify the costs, benefits, and patient preferences for chemotherapy in this patient population is warranted in order to minimize the effect of nonmedical biases on management decisions","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",Lung,"Health Services and Economics Branch, Applied Research Program",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=10807806,0,1,0,0

Health Psychol 2015;34(11):1066-1075",2015,With others or alone? Adolescent individual differences in the context of smoking lapses,"OBJECTIVE: Although a great deal of adolescent smoking research has investigated predictors of initiation, much less has focused on predictors of lapsing during a quit attempt. In particular, the role of social context may deserve greater attention in models of adolescent smoking cessation. Therefore, the present investigation aimed to use ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to examine individual differences in social lapsing--the extent to which lapses occur around others versus when alone. METHODS: Analyses focused on 179 adolescent smokers (aged 14-18 years) engaged in an unassisted quit attempt. There were 2 general EMA assessment intervals: prequit (1 week) and postquit (2 weeks). Participants reported every time that they smoked a cigarette and at random, nonsmoking times; in each assessment, participants responded to questions about their current environment, behaviors, and psychological state. A 3-month follow-up assessed longer-term smoking-related outcomes. RESULTS: Consistent with other adolescent research, the overall rate of lapsing was very high (93%). Social lapsing rates were likewise high (among those who lapsed, 73% reported their first lapse was social), but they also varied continuously across individuals. We computed a social lapsing coefficient for each youth and found that it related to smoking factors at baseline (e.g., lower smoking intensity and dependence) and follow-up (e.g., lower cotinine levels). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that higher rates of social lapsing are associated with being a lighter, less dependent smoker and having better eventual cessation prospects. Findings provide evidence that accounting for variability in social lapsing may improve theory and treatment.","NCI Researcher, Extramural Researcher",,Behavioral Research Program,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=25664557,1,0,1,0

Four focus groups and two individual interviews were conducted with 19 survivors to profile experiences and identify key concerns for future interventions. The resultant themes reflect cancer care continuum challenges (such as delays in diagnosis, problems with adherence), psychosocial concerns (such as infertility and reproductive concerns, changing social relationships, financial burden), and the paradox of being diagnosed with cancer as a young adult.
